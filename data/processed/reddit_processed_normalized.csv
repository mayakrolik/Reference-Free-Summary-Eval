Later that day I hopped in the shower and, following a pro-tip I learned from Reddit, used my old loofah to scrub out any extra ...residue that might have gotten caught up in my butt fro. At the exact instant the loofah came in contact with my hole, I nearly passed out from the pain. It felt as if someone had sodomized me with an industrial cheese grader. My vision started to blur and I had to brace myself against the side of the shower so I wouldn't fall down. After about 5 minutes of recovering in this position, I finally regained enough courage to examine myself. I positioned a finger to where I thought my butt hole would be and discovered a shockingly large swollen abscess that was painful to touch and very tender.\n\nSo now I'm left wondering, is this a hemorrhoid or some crazy STD? How did I get it in the first place, how do I not get it in the future and how do I make it go away? Is this normal for 23 year old guys? Thanks in advance Reddit.\n\nNote: It's been three days now and my butt hole still hurts. I haven't dared to touch it again, but I don't think the abscess has gotten any smaller.

I don't mean to be accusatory, as there are plenty of instructors that do not act like this and show students the respect they need to excel in school (obviously if they deserve it). But if you do act like this, change your attitude. Or go do something else with your life. Or go suck a railroad spike."," If you're a teacher and a student brings you something they found interesting/relevant to class, don't be a dickhole about it; show interest in it even if its the most boring piece of shit you've ever seen.","[""Wording doesn't match the author's but the context is correct.

She smokes pot A LOT. She has told me she has a prescription for it; though we do live in an area where smoking pot is illegal. Her living room is immediately below my bathroom/bedroom. The building is old and has poor insulation which therefore means every time she smokes it fills my bathroom (and bedroom) with the smell of pot. When I first moved in I enquires with all the owners at a meeting (very small building and it's not professional managed) and each one claimed they don't smoke pot. I knew someone was lying as it cannot be smelled while outside, only inside my unit. One day I approached my neighbours door for something unrelated and was hit with the smell of pot as soon as I approached. She's since confirmed that she smokes pot but refuses to stop or smoke it outside. \n\nBeside the fact that I've never done pot and find the smell disgusting, I'm intending to apply for my city's police department. They have a very strict policy regarding drugs (for example, cutting out family members who do drugs, asking someone who rents to move, etc). I am very concerned that by ignoring this problem and smelling pot all the time I will be affecting my chances of being hired. \n\nI do not want to involve police if possible. It's a small building and this would cause a lot of animosity. \n\nI am looking for advice on how to escalate this and hopefully come to a resolution.

FL, US\nMy boyfriend and I live in a managed apartment community, have lived here for about two years. We moved to this city in huge part because of the lower living expenses. When we moved in, we were told to expect increases of at least $25 on lease renewal, and last year the rent increased $27 which was *totally* reasonable. Currently we pay $936/month for a 2/2, which we split about 40/60.\n\nThe other day I got a renewal offer in my email, the lowest priced option was $1051/month, which is an increase of $115 a month and seems unreasonable. I called and spoke to one of the girls in the front office and was told she can regenerate the renewal offer in a week and see if the prices change, but the manager was not around so I couldn't get any more info\n\nWhat's the best course of action here? For background, we are doing okay financially(0 debt, we each have at least a 6 month emergency fund, there's money left over to save each month but not a ton), but we are planning to get married soon and the extra $115 a month is money I had mentally put aside for modest rings and a short honeymoon. Add to that, we will have about $2k in additional expenses in November outside of our regular bills... so the idea of our rent going up after that stresses me out.\n\nMy question is this -- is there anything we can do about this? I've looked up the law where I live and they are within their rights to increase the rent however much they want as long as they give us notice. I have drafted a letter detailing our excellent payment history, how we've never had any problems, mentioning the cost/risk of new tenants, etc., and suggesting that the max increase we will accept is 5%... but I'm not sure that this would have any effect. The girl I spoke to in the office basically said ""the computer does it"" and that she has no say, but I'm thinking the manager might. Does anyone have any experience with this?

His wife's sister was the maid of honor. Just to give you an idea of the age range of everyone, the bride and groom are both 24.\n\nAnyway, I live a state over from all of them so I visited for all of last week.

He and I won't see each other during the summer months since we'll be in different states working, and we'll move in together right when he gets back. I am one hundred percent ready to make this leap with him, but what makes me hesitate is that he recently told me that his love for me comes and goes in waves, and that he feels more fulfilled when he is alone because he is more productive. This brought on the topic that he thinks that living together like this will either solidify our relationship or end it. I think it's a bit strange to bring this up while still planning on moving in together... Our relationship has been a bit rocky because of the lack of productivity together. When we're together, we just want to BE together: not be bothered by friends, school, etc. Just be in each others company. This has made both of our grades suffer, and friendships. Which has soured the relationship. We both said that when we look back on our history together, it's been great but not as great as it could be because of how little we have actually done. I am just worried that this isn't the right step to take in our relationship if he feels so rocky about it, and if our relationship is based off of a history of non-productivity. \nHave any of you been in this situation?

When we started dating, things were really great, really easy, and went really fast. Within a month we were already so close and I could see myself marrying this girl within a year or two (I'm 23, she's 26). We get along great, spend decent time together, and I can tell that she really cares about me. She has all the qualities of a good spouse, good mother, good life partner.\n\nWe've now been dating for 4-5 months and things are starting to slow down and I'm becoming less passionate about the relationship. I want to be with her, but i'm not crazy passionate about it. I don't wake up every morning with a burning desire to be with her, crazy about being with her. I know that it's unrealistic to have this feeling every minute of everyday, but I haven't felt that way since the first few weeks of our relationship.\n\nI also have to admit, even though it makes me feel shallow and a bad person, that my attraction to her isn't top notch. I am attracted to her, and we do have a physical aspect of our relationship, but she's not the most attractive women I know (or dated).\n\nI should also mention that we are both christain and that God is a central part of our relationship. Its something that we can share together and has been a good way to bring us together. I've slept with 2 girls before, she's a virgin, we have decided to wait before marriage to have sex. I'm ok with it, though I do fear that it will have an impact on our intimacy (possibly a source for my lack of attraction?)\n\nSo what should I do? Am i expecting too much from the relationship? Is physical attraction an unimportant thing in the long run as long as we have an intimate connection? If I choose to ignore these feelings, will they come back to haunt the relationship later?\n\nThanks for your help."," GF is awesome, good/healthy relationship.

She's pushing me into it, I've been with a girl once for 4 months or so, but she knows that I'm not into girls anymore, but I guess she thinks she can force me into becoming a lesbian.

We didn't really mention it at first because we just didn't think about it - we all knew I'm a 'jailbait' and I knew he had to be at least 18 or older, apparently our age difference is 6 years. I'm stressing over it. \n\nFor Valentines day he's going to take me out. I'm really excited for it and if we have the same click again, I think we will become a couple. Just...

This year they started making us 'dress out' in shorts and t-shirts. Right around this time, I've become a fan of the freedom offered by not wearing underwear, and it is grand. \nOne day, without thinking it through, I bring breakaway shorts (i.e. with buttons on the sides) to change into for class. Naturally, flag football is that day's activity. \n\nSo we head out onto the field for our game. It is a beautiful day. The sun is shining; I distinctively remember a cool breeze. The girl's gym class walks the track around field while we play. \n\nI deliberately avoid the ball most of the game. We have about 10 minutes left to play and our QB sends me a pass. I *tried* to drop it but the pass was too perfect to play it off. So I bolt for the endzone, with (I'll call him) Nick's bitch ass chasing me. So I run it in and we all cheer, but fucking Nick is compelled to complete his defensive duty and take my flag.\n\nYou know what fucking happened. Goddamn Nick grabbed a fistful of flag and shorts, and with a seriously unnecessary flourish ripped it all away. \n\nSo everyone is laughing. Girls on the track are bumping into other girls who stopped to laugh. I'm struggling to cover up and get my shorts back at the same time, but *fucking Nick* plays keep-away.

It was $30k in total, but I've always been pretty impoverish in my life, so it was a pretty *scary* number at the time. I spent a month trying to find jobs in my field, but knew that the pay I was receiving at the time would never match what my federal obligation would be.\n\nSo I jumped into a career in electrical work due to the fact that it was the only full-time position I could get in my area. I left my first electrical employer due to some stupid personal decisions on my end (job scams are the suck), but managed to enter the IBEW apprenticeship program.\n\nNow, being in the apprenticeship program did help pay the bills, but I live in a Deep Red State, and our Union is weak as piss.

What do I do?\nA while ago my Dad asked me to use the laptop to print something out for him for work. I didn't know what the website it was on was called so I just went into the history to find it there. There were a few porn sites like Pornhub, YouPorn etc there, but that didn't bother me. My Dad works nights a lot so he regularly takes the laptop with him, so I just assumed he would visit the sites then. There were also some of those ""HOT SINGLES IN YOUR AREA!!"" type things but I thought they were just some of those crappy ads that redirect you on porn sites. I deleted the history just in case it ever came up in the search box while other people were around, and I forgot about it until today. A family friend's computer is broken so she asked to come around later to use ours to print something out. I said sure, and checked the history just in case, but I found a massive list of cheating sites visited a week ago. There must have been about 11 or 12 different sited visited one after the other, sites like Ashley Madison, Easysex, along a load of others with names like ""MILFbang"" and ""Localfuck"". There's no way that this many sites could be the result of some scummy ads. I deleted the history again, but I now wish I'd at least taken a screenshot first.

As a result, we often fought, a lot, about all types of stupid, pointless shit.

She agrees she doesn't want it to end and all is well. A few days later, she breaks up with me saying she can't be with me. I tried for a little over a week to fix things with her, but she was not interested. As a result, another massive fight ensued, which ended on bad terms for both of us. Consequently, she went out to a frat party got drunk, and proceeded to ""try and meet new guys to forget about me"" (her words). That ended in her babbling on to some interested guy about me until she threw up on him. At that point, she wanted to fix things, but I was too off put by the idea that she had moved on so quickly (trying to meet other people) to want to fix anything. But she begged and pleaded and explained and justified and as of right then, we decided we would talk when she came down for winter. It was mutually stressed that we were not together, nor were things fixed, but that we did think we owe it to ourselves to talk and see where we stood. \n\nLast night, out of frustration (both physical, emotional and mental), i went out and made a bootycall of another ex girlfriend. Afterwards, I felt weird. I felt a tinge of disgust for myself, but I could not really try and make myself feel worse because I was simply a single guy.

She's single.\n\nShe knows me and that we're in a relationship, but I don't know if she necessarily respects that. While this wouldn't have bothered me if it were one of his long-time friends who sent it, she isn't super close with him. She also has had a history of (in my opinion) acting flirtatious with him and crossing some lines with her behavior, and a couple times, being really disrespectful toward me when I saw her in person. I get the impression that she's sneaky and manipulative - I think she has an agenda - but my boyfriend disagrees and thinks she's innocent and just trying to be friends.\n\nIn any case, a while back, I got pretty uncomfortable with her behavior, so I asked him to set some firmer boundaries with her. He did, and he actually ended up going a step further and distancing himself from her as a friend. They only talk every now and then, and she's not happy about that - she tries to contact him a lot, and posts a lot of passive aggressive posts on social media. I think she blames me for losing her friendship with him - which isn't necessarily untrue, but the reason I intervened was because of the way she was choosing to act in the first place. \n\nBut back to the current situation: to make it worse, he didn't tell me about the message even though we were on a trip together on valentine's day. He usually tells me if he hears from her, so it's weird that he didn't mention it this time. Should i consider this to be a red flag? And either way, how should I approach this?

I feel really stressed out about living with them-- like I'm a burden, like I get in their way. They also stress me out sometimes. I am very noise sensitive, and sometimes when they fight about things it makes me feel really non functional and ruins my day.\n\nI was apartment hunting a bit because of this and found a place in the city that I thought was great. It's a little out of my budget long term, but it's month to month so I thought I could just get it for three months or so and not lose too much money on rent. I tentatively agreed to take it, but no money changed hands. The guy told me that someone else wanted it but that if I could pay the deposit before it her, the room was mine.\n\nThen two days went by where I didn't hear from the guy renting the place. I assumed that someone else had taken it and they just didn't want to tell me (this has happened to me a lot looking for a room share). \n\nHowever while time went by I started thinking about it and decided I wasn't sure about this place. The rent is hundreds of dollars a month more than I could afford, and I would have a lot of roommates (about 7), so it wouldn't even be quiet, which is the main thing I'm looking for. \n\nThe guy just got back to me today asking when I could make the deposit, and I had to tell him I wasn't sure I would. He wrote back saying they were counting on me taking the place and this would make a lot of problems for them. I feel bad about what happened, but I also don't think I should have to take this place when all I did was express interest. He also apparently forgot to call me back to discuss putting down the deposit, which made me lose confidence in him as a landlord.\n\nAt the same time, I'm growing more and more frustrated with living at home, and this place is about the best deal I could get for an apartment in this city in terms of location, neighborhood, and flexibility on the lease."," should I take a possibly sketchy apartment that is over my budget but could be temporary, or  just make peace with living at home longer?","[""Summary isn't terrible and conveys main idea but no where in the post does it say the apartment is possibly sketchy.""]",0.7686948735598905,0.642808901830406,0.9999999999999999,0.9999999999999999,0.5922963451928107,0.2693834301018346,0.4018926574289145,0.8007101243993806,0.2979404165955868,0.4321687010637982,0.4590336949641728,0.26426105081952045,0.22419252900733255,0.23165381508251137,0.13198842387763587,0.10694444604370132,0.5309309502550349,0.10681720608569643,0.09312367354845572,0.26916274848813215,0.14705737792307447,0.12392741171231914,0.5458182224882513

Even though we're still young it truly feels like he's it for me and vice versa. However, recently we hit a crossroad and he decided to end things. Since in Druze culture you are unable to marry out of the culture and if you do you are no longer considered a druze, and then you and your family are looked down on and shunned in the community. However, some people i talk to say in druze culture it's different for guys and it may be acceptable for them to marry someone outside the culture. He doesn't really follow his religon/culture, he's just scared of how it'll affect his parents, he says he can't loose them or let them down. He doesn't want them to die unhappy, feeling like they failed. I really dont think they'd completely disown him, and i think he knows that, he just wants them to die content and they apparently can't if hes with someone outside the culture. But then if he chooses to abide his parents wishes he says he'll just be alone and not marry, meaning he isnt going to be happy... so confusing. But by being appart its destroying the both of us, im unable to move on and let go of him, i just can't give up hope. And he is regretting his choice everyday, but he's so torn.

I think this is partially because I have avoidance issues, and am a bit embarrassed by how illiterate I've allowed myself to be (financially) as an adult. \n\nFull disclosure: I've taken a hands-off approach to our personal finances, and I think this has placed an unfair burden on my wife. I fully intend to change this. \n\nIt's time for me to help wrangle our monthly finances and start making our money work for us. \n\nAs a baseline: we have roughly $750 left over from my paychecks after taking care of all of our set bills (Student Loans, Car Payment, etc.). We still need to eat, pay for gas, and prepare for general living expenses. \n\nMy question is - how should I go about building a realistic budget? We both come from bad families, and didn't have any early-life financial literacy...I'm just feeling overwhelmed with the learning curve to financial success. \n\nI understand the general tenets of being financially sound: define a budget, don't spend more than you earn, don't max out credit cards, etc. But what I'm really hoping to get is someone to say: ""You have $750, this is what I would do with it"" while keeping in mind that I still need to eat, etc.", I have $750 every month after monthly bills to feed/clothe myself and my wife. How should we go about maximizing that money?,"[""The summary almost gets everything wrong. The $750 was the remaining amount after set bills and not after food and clothes.

Could this work?\nAlright, so I'm F25 and he's M27ish.\n\nSo one of my best friends and I met at a summer camp when we were both in primary school. She had a brother a couple years older, and the three of us would go on adventures across the neighborhood and wreak havoc in local playgrounds everywhere. Once high school started, my friend and I started drifting apart. Her family was incredibly religious and mine was becoming increasingly liberal in the changing political climate. Although our families remained friends throughout it all, I can't help but feel her parents seeing us as a bad influence. Although we lived down the street from each other, my friend and her brother were sent to private Christian schools for the rest of their education, giving me fewer reasons to see her or her brother.\n\nYears pass, my friend's brother moves out of state for college, and she follows suite after she's done with high school, and I don't really hear from them until four years later when he moves back home and I decide to solicit his help on a website I wanted to make. I felt like we really bonded over this. He was really cool and incredibly helpful, funny, and smart to boot! Although he went to a private schools, he's very open-minded about civil rights issues, we have similar political affiliations, watch the same TV shows, and he isn't ashamed to like musicals.\n\nMy main problem is that I've had a history of horrible relationships. Not even horrible in the way most people think. I feel like there's a very strong chance I'm asexual. I've been in four big relationships that I felt helped me become the person I am today, and I'm thankful for it, but they all ended with the fact that I was unwilling to have sex with my partner.\n\nI feel a sense of security with him, because I know he would never do anything outside of my comfort zone. However I don't start a lot of relationships because I feel guilty about not being able to satisfy my partners. One of my biggest concerns is that if he does wind up liking me back, and we start dating, and something happens causing us to break up, this could mean bad things for our family's already fragile relationship.\n\nOKSO", I have a crush on my friend's brother I've known since we were 8.

(I understand reddit is no substitute for that.)\n\nA little background. . . I have a 3 year old Australian Shepherd. He is very well behaved for the most part. He listens to all basic commands and makes good eye contact most of the time. He is quite defensive of the yard and property. If someone comes to the door or a loud car drives by he barks and growls. He quickly quiets down when you ask him to. (Most of the time except when he is in the yard alone) He gets along very well with other dogs and people. If someone new is coming to the house he is standoffish at first but quickly is very friendly. (As long as I say its ok) He is well excercised for the most part. (Walk to a field and then 45 minutes+ of running/fetch/frisbee) In the winter time he goes outside less but doesn't seem to act any differently. I do alot of indoor training/play with him as well.\n\nThe other day my friends phone rang and he stood up about to answered it. At the same time my dog started growling and attacked him. He stopped after a few seconds (gave him sit commands etc) but was still very heated. My friend went in the other room for his phone call and it seemed like my dog wanted to follow him. We both thought the ringtone agitated him.\n\nAre there any clear cut training methods to stop this behavior? It happened twice now with two different people. He is completely fine with the person before and shortly after it happens. It really comes out of nowhere. I have tried to replicate the scenario but haven't been able to. I have also shown him a ringing phone etc.\n\nAlso if anyone has tips about making him less defensive of the yard it would be great! Sometimes he barks at people that are 4+ houses away. Once he bolted out the door and barked and circled the mailman. I have watched a bunch of youtube videos and done alot of googling but haven't found anything that worked yet.I get that this particular breed is quite defensive., Dog attacked when friends cell phone rang and friend went to answer.

I was trying to fall asleep a bit earlier than usual (around 11PM) because I had a job interview at 9AM, but kept waking up every 5 minute because of this one fucking mosquito that would just pierce through my skin and bounce without even getting a decent meal from my vasculature.

It took me another 30 minutes to capture this bastard in my bathroom and I tossed some green GoldBond (I use it to cool my balls after a shower) on to this fucker thinking it would slow it down. I kept peppering this fucker with GoldBond and missed so many times until my bathtub and my girlfriend's bright pink towels were completely caked with this magical shit. The GoldBond seemed to do pretty well in slowing it down because I finally caught one of its legs with a tweezer and proceeded to torture and dissect it.

This weekend, for some reason, I asked my girlfriend for the first time how many guys she has slept with. She told me I was the 9th guy. I was expecting around 3 or 4.  To me, she doesn't seem to be the type of girl who sleeps around (I don't even know if 9 guys qualifies as sleeping around).  Even in our relationship, being comfortable sexually is something we have had to work on.  That's why I was kind of shocked when she told me I was the 9th guy she's slept with.  She told me that she used to view sex as not very meaningful, but that it is very different with me.  She's told me numerous times that I mean a lot more to her than any other guys ever have.

During my consultation the doctor looked at my stomach and said verbatim ""My technique will do nothing for you, you need a tummy tuck."" The way he explained it was that there is not enough fat on my stomach to make his technique viable. So in short... this actually may all be skin on me and I may be DONE losing weight. The only places he said he knew he could do anything were my love handles and chest. I'm going to get a real medical BMI scan before I make any moves on this so I have hard numbers as to what is actually where but like I said earlier, those numbers could reveal that I'm done with weight loss and it's time to start managing my skin better. I'd just like to point out that I'm not going to do a tummy tuck, down time from that could cost me my job and is just unmanageable (Not to mention invasive surgery scares the shit out of me).

I have been doing a lot of self reflection lately, having just come out of a 1.5yr relationship 2 months ago. \n\nThere's something about myself I developed during this relationship that I don't like and I think it's unhealthy. It's hard to explain but I became very attached to this person, so much so that I would get very anxious when they were away from me. It made me uneasy when ever she was out or away. I kept thinking she would meet someone else. I felt as though she is wasn't really interested in me, and I would do things to make her jealous. \n\nI had really high self esteem going into the relationship, but it got lower and lower during my time with her. It felt as though she always kept me at an arms length, saying she has to maintain her independence. She kept secrets, and didn't really communicate to me. She would flirt with other guys. When I told her my feelings that I don't appreciate that, she said that she can do what ever she wants that she's a grown woman. \n\nIt's confusing me because with my ex-ex-gf, it was different. I loved when she would go away and I had time to myself. I missed her still, but it wasn't crippling and playing on my mind all the time. I could still relax and look forward to having her come home. \n\nCan anyone identify what is going on here? I don't want this to carry on into future relationships.

About about halfway through, I graduated and left university. Since then, we've been doing long-distance, but it's only about a 2 hour drive (I understand this is not a vast distance). Since then, I've tried my best to visit, sometimes she does (once every 3 weeks at most, typically every two weeks with back-to-back weekends not uncommon). She can be a bit needy and clingy. I try to cater to those needs, within reason. I send care packages, talk to her often, and do my best to spoil her when we do see each other. I do my best to keep our romance.\n\nHowever, when we are apart she finds herself sad and second guessing the relationship. She's apprehensive about our future because it is highly likely that we won't ever be in the same city for the foreseeable future. In spite of this, I'm fully committed to her. She is a good person, the type of woman I want to be with and have a future with. Unfortunately, she's apprehensive because she sees sadness as a component of being long-distance. For me, I'd rather try my hardest and potentially fail doing long distance. For her, she'd rather get out now than to hurt more later. However, she says she sincerely wants to be with me, but is unsure and unconfident in my abilities to fulfill her needs in a relationship.\n\nWhat can I do? How can I show her that we can do long distance and still have a healthy relationship?\n\nOr do I have to accept that this just won't work out?

Sometimes we'd be having a fairly in-depth conversation (that she sometimes brings up), or she'd be ranting to me about something, when all of a sudden, her messages just stop. I realize that there are probably a number of reasons why she may not be replying; she's a lot more social than I am and often talks to multiple people at once, not all of my messages warrant a response, or that she's just busy, but it's still fairly annoying to see, especially since I'm the sort of individual that tries to send some sort of acknowledgement to all messages that I receive, or tell them if I can't talk at the moment.

She turned it down, saying that she would stay with me, but it will be over if I ever watch pornography again. Nor can I break up with her, seeing that she has personal issues where my support is extremely precious to her. Walking away could destroy her.\n\nThere's not much more to say. She and I go along together extremely well and I have to count myself lucky that she still wants to stay with me and I will have to work hard to win back her trust.

Please let me explain. \n\nMy boyfriend, lets call him Bubba, have been together for almost four years. We've been friends for almost seven. For the past two years I have been living with him and his Mother. My Mom and I had a very bad relationship, so his Mom graciously invited me into her home. For the most past, we really love each other. We do fight, but I can honestly see myself settling with him. He's the most generous man I've ever encontured. \n\nBack to the question, Bubba applied to a very prestigious school. I can't afford to leave the city yet, so I was just going to move downtown and go to school there. This would mean we would be close to three hours apart. I know a lot of people can make long distance relationships work, but I knew I couldn't. It's been making me miserable thinking about not being with him whenever I want. Plus, we have two cats and he would be taking them. I didn't want to split them up because they love each other. \n\nToday he found out that he didn't get in. Of course, he is crushed. He's now doubting his intelligence and the fact that he went back to school. He took off a few years and when we started dating I motivated him to go back. Since he has been back, he has been excelling in every class. Everyone thought he would get in without a problem.

She spends a lot of nights over at my place, and I noticed that whenever I went to take a shower before bed, after I came back she would be on my laptop and quickly close down some open tabs. I didn't think much of it the first few times, figuring maybe she was looking at something embarrassing, but then I noticed it turned into an every night thing whenever we spent a few days together.\n\nI checked my browser history, and she is looking at her ex's facebook. Specifically, her ex, and her ex's new girlfriend. I know that she had a rough breakup very shortly before we started dating. She was married to him for 6 years and said that he was very controlling and not a good match for her, and when she wanted to leave he put her through a huge guilt trip and made it difficult. I've noticed that about once a week she will exchange a few texts with him and be off in the bathroom crying about it. \n\nThat said, she has told me how happy she is with me and doesn't know why she is still sad about a bad relationship ending. I figured some of it was just curiousity over what her ex was doing and who he was with, but coupled with the crying about it makes me wonder if she is just not over him.\n\nI don't know what to do about the situation because when she does the weekly crying routine, she is emotionally wrecked for the whole night and it sucks. I've tried to be understanding and give her space, but it's not getting better. The Facebook thing also affects her. During the day/evening she will be flirty and talking about all the stuff we're going to do in bed, and then after I get out of the shower and she's been on his Facebook, it's like she's emotionally unavailable the rest of the night.\n\nI really love her though so I want to try and make it work, it's just I'm not sure of the right way to handle this situation.", GF is looking at her ex's facebook all the time and texting/crying once a week with him.

Was married, got divorced, had a long term long distance relationship that ended two times because she cheated on me with her ex. I recently moved, and have been using online dating to no avail since I got here until this last week. Met a girl on a dating site, we hit it off I thought, talked for about a week before going out to dinner the other night. I thought that things went really well, we talked for hours, kissed goodnight, and all that good stuff. She said she had a really good time and wanted to go out with me again\n\nThat was Wednesday night, since then she's seemed distant when we've texted, and we haven't talked very much at all.

Then she's busy all day tomorrow and on Monday as well. \n\nI really like her, but I'm not sure how to take all of this. It's certainly plausible that she's simply been busy with work and her life and hasn't had time to talk to me.

During that time, I applied to about 15-20 jobs per week and had an interview roughly every week and a half.  \n\nThis time around, with more experience and the same level of effort, I have had a total of 3 interviews, but these were not direct hires so I'm faced with the same risks as I have been at the last two positions.

How will this help my tax returns?\nThis is my first post ever on Reddit so please bear with me. \n\nA little backstory to begin, when I was a child my father bought 2.3 acres of property in a school district that he wanted us to attend in South Carolina. The hope was one day to build a house, however, as time passed that never materialized. We've owned the property for 20 years and over that time we've paid property taxes, sometimes late in the face of financial instability. Currently, we're doing better but still its an unnecessary financial burden and we'd like to capitalize on the property value having doubled since when we purchased, valued at $30,000 currently. We hired a realtor to sell the property a couple months ago but it has sat without much interest.  \n\nWe discovered our neighbors have been removing the for sale signs because they don't want someone to build on the wooded lot. We have left letters in the community's mailboxes detailing the problem. Without knowing which neighbor is doing it, we can't report them. Though the property is listed online, I'm pretty upset that there's not a on-site advertisement. In my frustration I was trying to think of alternatives while possibly irking the neighbors. I came up with an idea that actually was feasible and not too dramatic. We could either donate or sale the land for a reduced price and use it as a tax deduction; we considered Habitat for Humanity or Helping Hands. The problem, I know very little about about the tax deductions allowed/ how it would be applied. I read the full market value of the land is deductible but what does that mean in terms of tax refunds come next year? \n\nI want to do some good for the community; I have a BA in architecture and during college I was involved in community building and designed low income housing for those in need. My father has a similar sentiment but is business oriented and wants to reclaim his investment. I feel like this solution scratches both itches. Also, I would be lying if I didn't get some enjoyment at the prospect of inconveniencing the neighbors. Any ideas or information is welcome even if they aren't directly related to this idea. I just need advice on how to move the property with the maximum benefit for all (except those dick neighbors.)"," If I donate a piece of land to charity out of spite, can I deduct it from my taxes and if so, how much of the value would be retuned as a refund (all, none, some?)","['could include more info about how/why the donation is ""in spite"" otherwise good summary']",0.7686948735598905,1.0,0.7602490078029613,0.9999999999999999,0.4391525001546689,0.7070299573636458,0.143078191052672,1.0,0.7536244058799677,0.0,0.6504996415744325,0.07122691424346428,0.15880479284236415,0.08614642068105738,0.3037381349936856,0.25988094621273683,0.5991334673233769,0.1536973883475245,0.1374021508463684,0.2762751884595366,0.13416104450496383,0.11972577295213305,0.2482182837946154

I'm a pretty confident, outgoing woman and have asked out men on several occasions. I don't tend to be too shy if I really want something, however, can be in some situations. \n\nI was at the grocery store today at lunch time and was waiting in line to check out. There was a woman who was having difficulty checking out with her multiple credit cards and people in line were noticeably getting impatient. There were two people in front of me in line, and the person directly in front of me was a very cute guy. Sometimes in these situations people kind of glance around to others waiting for visual commiseration of some sort, surely many of you reading have probably experienced this. \n\nThe cute guy kind of glanced back at me and smiled but I had one of my headphones in listening to music, so I nodded back. I kept noticing him kind of attempting to look my way (or possibly he was just annoyed and waiting, hard to tell). \n\nI kept thinking, ""huh, I'd love to find a way to give this guy my number"". It's hard enough to meet people you think are attractive or interested in dating.

She was drinking (too much) with 2 of her friends and 5 other people she did not know, on a camping beach, near a lake. Nobody was sober enough and some of them took a midnight bath while clearly drunk. I hope I am not overreacting if I think that it is dangerous, mainly because the drowning risk… Anyway, I realized that even if I gave her some big brother drinking advice (things like « if you don't feel like drinking because suddenly, the taste of alcohol kinda disgust you, it is time to stop, no matter what your friends tell you to do, you will not have a good time if you continue »), I never mentioned certain situations (like drowning while drunk).\n\nIn particular, It made me realize that I never told her something like « dudes flirting with you while drunk sometimes misinterpret your signals (by clumsiness or malignancy) and bad things can happen to you, so do not get too drunk with people you barely know/trust to be able to react well if it happens ». I want to tell her that and I want to make her understand that it is serious, but something I've understood by reading feminists books/articles is that many women live in a constant (and horrifying) fear of rape, and when some asshole rapes a woman, this woman often feels some guilt, feeling that it's her fault, that she should have been less clumsy, put on less sexy clothes, drunk less, etc.\n\nI do not my sister to feel that way, and moreover, I do not want to be a part of the transmission of this rape culture which blames victims! On the other hand, I want her to understand that this is a serious issue and that even if, in an ideal world without rapists, she shouldn't have to worry about it, she should be aware of this issue and avoid stupidly risky situations.\n\nHow would you advise me to phrase my advice to her?

Bad friendships, new dog, kicking a housemate out for her. After every tense situation, I am the one apologizing and I understand I haven't handled things exactly as she wanted, but it worries me how few mistakes she has admitted and how empathetic she is not. I read recently that people who love you are by your side even when you suck. I feel that is the only time when we are not close. Like the success of this relationship depends on my ability to make x number of mistakes or fewer. Shouldn't it be more about understanding each others' intentions and avoiding offending each other, while forgiving mistakes? I feel that she has never really forgiven me. Each time I apologize she accepts it as if I said ""it won't happen again"" instead of accepting it because it was an honest miscommunication or mistake. Similarly, she rarely apologizes because she is who she is. I'll admit that she makes very few mistakes but the ones she makes are very personal like not paying attention to me when I am sad or not acknowledging the legitimacy of my feelings. She is an affectionate person but only on her own time. There are very specific occasions that people need a hug or a shoulder and she does not look for ways to console me in those times, despite my requests that she be more attentive.

The problem lies with the fact his girlfriend is also a very good friend of mine, and so if I confront the issue between them, im walking away without a friend. \n\nI know he's better than this, but I am extremely upset. Furthermore, if it was something that happened 2 years ago, I would accept he fucked up and moved on, but Kate decides to tell me that he contacted her this spring. Which means, once a cheater always a cheater. His excuse for it was pathetic, Kate knew she fucked up and declined any more efforts of his.\n\nSo reddit, what should I do? Part of me is inclined to erase this from my memory, it's none of my business, it's between Adam, Kate, and Adam's GF. On the other hand, Adam's gf is crazy about him, wants to marry him, and seeing her waste her life away on this guy is heartbreaking. If I told her, I am scared of what he might to do - he lives with me and it will get ugly, as he has anger issues  (albeit, not as bad as they used to be) and tends to act on impulse rather than with his head. Any advice would be greatly appreciated, thank you."," Best friend cheated with a co-worker, his gf is also my best friend and I am stuck in situation where want to drop the issue, it isn't any of my business, but I feel she deserves to know.","[""Main idea is there but it's missing OP's question.""]",0.7686948735598905,1.0,0.7602490078029613,0.9999999999999999,0.5265566472726338,0.6534971870614306,0.1289454969203696,0.792034981419306,0.31331443050247754,0.0,0.256583555864345,0.4598395988042885,0.42632783182462575,0.44399981451844006,0.4759322375541801,0.42533782055691727,0.5817316423102732,0.3333392800780693,0.3085036427423603,0.4338387766880013,0.3593461764509631,0.3314843813988595,0.424072793022673

Any advice is appreciated...\nHere's the story:\nIn December 2011, my wife and I made an offer on a home, which was eventually accepted.  The home was a foreclosed property, owned by Aurora Mortgage Services.  Closing date, dictated by the seller, was to be February 10th, 2012 (tomorrow).  We fulfilled our end of agreement - provided earnest money deposit, secured financing, obtained insurance, and as far as we were concerned were ready for closing.  As a matter of fact, title agency (again, dictated by the seller) contacted us and scheduled the time for the actual close.  However, on Tuesday, February 7th, we were notified that Aurora has placed all of their assets on hold ""until further notice"", but that periodically, properties will be ""released from hold"" - whatever that might mean.  \nI've done some research online and came up with [this blog]  It appears that we are not the only ones currently dealing with this.\nSo now, our options are to file for an extension, or get our earnest money back and walk.  By choosing the later option, we loose out on the inspection money, appraisal and cost of gas that had to be turned on for the said two things (all together around $1,000).  We don't necessarily want to walk, because we like the house, but our current lease is set to expire next month.

I turn to look at the cop, and both her and her partner are staring at me. I just ignore it as the lights turn green and they turn left as I go straight. A couple of seconds later, I see in my rear view mirror that they pull a 360 in the middle of the intersection and their lights turn on. I assume they got a distress call until they start tailing me.

She thinks it's reasonable to go out to eat every weekend (for about $125 for 2), go on expensive trips, and generally live pretty freely. However, neither of us make a ton of money (I make 45K, and she makes 28K + a few hundred/month from her Dad).

She generally points to the fact that I make more money than her, but she still gets money from her Dad, and she doesn't have many of the expenses I have (car payments, car/medical insurance, night classes, etc...). \n\nOn top of this, I generally drive her nearly everywhere (work, grocery store, etc...) and she hasn't once offered to pay for gas, nor does she offer to pay for food she eats at my house, or heat when she blasts the heater.

A while later, i went to start another convo on facebook with her, and it had appeared that i couldn't reply to her anymore, nor could I view her profile. I had found out she had blocked me. I'm assuming her new bf told her to block me on all social medias because he probably saw our previous messages, why i assume this is because we had talked before and whenever I would bring up the girl he would make an angry facial expression and also because he had also blocked me. So after I found out I was complaining to a best friend about this and he messaged the girl about how she had me blocked and she said ""I didn't know"".

It's not that I don't like to talk, I just don't usually talk unless I have something to say. That aside, women never talk to me first nor can they keep a conversation going. Even in group discussions in class, usually only the guys will discuss the topic with me. \n\nHere's the bizarre thing, I have a TON of gay friends that hit on me all the time. Why are the men so forward and confident, but women are all shy or uncomfortable / anxious around me? Tbh, I have the same amount of close gay friends as I have close straight guy friends. And obviously that ratio is pretty lopsided. And literally only women that I'm not very attracted to will try to be friends with me and they're always way cooler than most above average looking women(from my perspective). It's like there's some kind of tension there when I'm around attractive women. I don't know if it's what I say, or if I put off bad vibes, but it's usually only around attractive women. It's like even if I'm actually trying to hold a conversation, they don't contribute.\n\nMy luck has been bad enough to where I had sexual relations one time with my only best female friend and she has avoided hanging out with me ever since. I'm not sure what the problem was because we were pretty close. She didn't even give anything a chance, but I suspect this had to do with her relatively recent breakup.\n\nEvery women I've been with or been ""talking"" has said I'm too attractive for them. Idk if that's even related, but it's like they think they aren't good enough for me when I try to become more than friends. Sometimes I think how much easier it'd be if I was gay lol. Gay guys always find me one way or another, it happens all the time ha.\n\nAlso, my field of study has an inherent lack of women. That probably has a lot to do with the lack of women in my life in general. \n\nSo, what could the problem be??", I have a lot better luck with gay guys befriending me and talking to me than the same with women.

She ordered two appetizers (didn't share), a bunch of drinks, then steak and lobster, which came with a salad. Over the evening she didn't really let me talk, but she mostly complained. She ignored me 28 times to txt on her phone. Our food came and she sent back the lobster and had it replaced with shrimp. So she ate the shrimp, did not eat the steak, nor the accompanying veggies. She gave me an attitude that after we ate when I didn't give her money to gamble. She was really into her video slot so I said I had a good night, and told her I was leaving (politely). She gave me a half hug, did not look up from the machine to make eye contact nor did she thank me. Some other odd things she did: told me to tip more (15% wasn't enough) then complained about the service, how her legs got sweaty because it was too hot, smoked and blew towards me when she knew I am asthmatic, then ordered more complimentary bread at the end of the meal and ate it.\n\nSo I walked out of there thinking ok, we didn't click, she wasn't interested in me, I definately wasn't interested in her, as I found her behavior repugnant.

He started to come closer towards me, which I thought nothing of, and then put his arm around me and started moving in closer.  I wish I could say I was in the right mind and moved away from him, but I was drunk too and, as I said, I find him extremely attractive.  In a moment of clarity (before anything could happen) I looked at him and told him this was probably a huge mistake - we still have six months on our lease - and someone may end up getting hurt if we let anything happen between us.  It was hard for me, due to how much I genuinely like him as a person and how attractive I find him, but I think I made the right decision.\n\nThings have been slightly awkward since, and as much as I am trying to forget about it, I can't stop thinking about him - we are great friends and get along so brilliantly.  I am about 3 months out of a long relationship and never expected something like this to happen with him.

Post relationship, I maintained a sort of ""gay best friend"" friendship with her; a very very close platonic partnership. Jane was supportive me of in my quest for love through high school, and I tried to help her out as well, but she has yet to have any luck whatsoever.\n\nRecently I started dating a third girl, who we will call Jill. Jill is in the same small friend group as Jane is, and I gained interest in Jill at the beginning of this year of high school. Jane was supportive of me, but she had big doubts about my chances will Jill, until it slipped out that Jill knew I fancied her and wouldn't mind a date. Even though I have seen images of these conversations, Jane has been telling me that Jill doesn't want to date, which I know is false because we began chatting up and are prepared to do an official first date soon.\n\nAs soon as news of this broke, Jane began to be more hostile to me that usual. We went from chatting every day for a few hours to twice in the last 2 weeks. She also insults me more (this is significant because although we maintained a very sarcastic attitude with each other, she has begun to cross a line and be mean). Jane is stonewalling my efforts here; it is unfair of her to intrude on this new relationship of mine. However, I don't know how to deal with this, because Jane is possibly my best friend but still is being a big nuisance.\n\nI don't know what to do here; I don't think I have to pick between Jane and Jill but it seems that I have to make that choice. Can someone explain what is happening? I have been out of the dating game for some time so I don't really get what issues are happening."," I am split between Jane and Jill, and need help understanding Jane's issues so that I can properly deal with her and her very apparent jealousy",['Summary is very off.

He says he might finally be able to feel deep feelings again...but after six months?\nOkay, I am just very confused. I really need unbiased perspective on this. So this is a ""long distance"" relationship (we see each other on average every 2 weeks, but now get a full few weeks together), and we've been dating almost six months. He told me at the beginning of our relationship that he was...damaged? Not sure what word he used. Seemingly from whatever happened with his last girlfriend. I think they had been separated for 7-8 months before we started dating, and their relationship was like a year and a half.\n\nWell last night I finally got the details of what he meant. He says he thought she was perfect, and that his senior year when he was dating her was the best of his life. But that then she went to school and decided he wasn't as important to her as she had said. That messed him up, and he admits he shouldn't have believed she was perfect. But he says ever since that break up he hasn't felt capable of feeling deep feelings, and that now he is feeling anxious because he thinks maybe we are at that stage...and that so far he has been very guarded (I have too).\n\nI got upset because that means at the beginning of the relationship he knew he couldn't feel deep feelings. I didn't think that was fair to me. And I don't want to have to ""coach"" someone into feeling again...I shouldn't have to. It also seems like he's not over her...but he claims he is enough and no one is ever COMPLETELY over another person. Am I right in being upset? I have no idea how to proceed from here...\n\nAnd an outside issue--for the past few days I have been really distant with him because frankly he was annoying and I am pretty pessimistic about us spending longer than 2 years together (that is when I graduate)...I haven't told him that.", Boyfriend of six months finally says he may be able to develop deep feelings for me...but apparently has been closed off and incapable of doing so for our whole relationship thus far.

Everything was perfectly fine but all of a sudden I hear a ""BANG BANG"" really fucking loud and I was in the pen inside the building and during the loud BANG I heard yelling, then my stomach just dropped I was sure it was gun shots or something. It was extremely loud and had a Pop-ing sound So I droped the shovel and what I was doing and jumped over the walls seprateing the pens then sprinted out the back door onto a trail. After I got out far enough I called my Father warning him not to go the the Agriculture area. After the trail ended at a no trespassing sign I ran through bushes and branches getting scraped up until I reached the clearing where I ran down to the schools office. The first thing they notice is im shaking, sweating, and stuttering like a motherfucker and asked what happend. I reported the incident and someone went up to check it out. Turns out what happend was one of the older boys that were up there was angry and he has some issues so he grabed a pig cane and smashed it against the building twice breaking it. It takes alot of force to break one of those or even dent a building which lead me to belive it was a gun shot. But I don't know I just feel like a bit of a coward and a idiot all at the same time and feel kinda bad about myself a little bit. The boys both aplogized to me but i still feel like a jack ass.

People think i'm a nice guy, but as I said not popular. However my crush is popular and she's always around people. They always talk to her and never really leave her alone (not in a bad way). Therefore I can't really talk to her unless she sits next to me in class or I see her on her own (which would only be a few minutes). I do go to a thing outside of school where there is a lot less people and not as many of them talk to her, but the ones that do talk constantly.\n\nI think she thinks I'm a nice guy, but doesn't know me well enough to want to talk to me outside of class. \n\nSo what should I do here? I don't want to let go just yet. Help is appreciated. Thanks."," Crush is popular (I'm not that popular), can't talk to her outside of class, because of too many people talking to her and that she doesn't know me too well.","[""Clunky phrasing retains author's voice at cost to clarity.

He would get interviews, but unfortunately would not pass them.

I know she's old, but I read that rat terrier's life expectancy is 17-24 years old on google. She hasn't been to the vet ever, my parents don't have extra money for vet fees and pills for dogs. Other than that she has been a happy lively gal.  Here are some symptoms:\n-Walks slow and responds slow; she barely even does what I tell her to do for a treat like roll over or sit. She just looks at me.\n-she has slipped walking to the kitchen on our tile.\n-She pee's quite frequently on the carpet.\n-She lost most of her front teeth by now and her back molars are rotting. \n-She doesn't run to the door when someone rings the door bell.\n\nI am quite worried about her because she could not make it into the house after a walk this morning, a small step up into the doorway.

At first they sounded completely legit, but then they'd ask to speak with Bob. Since I'm not Bob, I'd tell them there's no one here named Bob, you have the wrong number. They would repeat my number back to me, and say they wanted to speak to Bob Zurncle. (Bob's Your Uncle, just in case you missed it) Needless to say, this has become increasingly annoying, especially since the caller is going through a lot of trouble, spoofing fake area codes, and always using this horribly stereotypical fake Hindi accent.

Regardless, I'll share my bland point of view since I was in attendance the entire time.\n\nIn the morning announcements, we were all instructed to empty out our lockers by the end of the day or risk losing whatever we failed to reclaim. Two friends and I — one friend, Zed (not his real name), being the character of importance — shared a locker, and the only remaining articles were our history textbooks and Zed's running shoes and opaque water bottle. Zed had told me throughout the year not to touch his bottle because it's ""a bomb"", and I never thought much of it until that day.\n\nDuring our break between second and third period, the three of us returned our textbooks and went with Zed to the bathroom, who intended to wash his bottle. He unscrewed the top and dumped the contents into one of the toilets — some pale orange liquid that, to me, faintly resembled vomit. He then proceeded to the nearest sink and left the now-empty bottle under some running water. At this point in time, there was nothing in the bathroom that smelled particularly bad.\n\nAlmost instantaneously, the air was pervaded by the most putrid stench conceivable, and, by split-second deduction, we pinpoint the cause to be whatever he poured out into the toilet. Half the people in the bathroom start coughing and grunting after mere seconds, many already trying to push past me and run out. I grabbed my friends and stumbled backwards with them out into the hallway, which was already completely obstructed by people who had retreated or were reluctant to enter (the odor had already seeped well out the doorway).\n\nSoon enough, you had a whole nauseated crowd lingering outside the bathroom, with no one besides us really knowing what was discharging that terrible redolence. I stood on the side laughing for a good ten minutes while the crowd (but not the stink) gradually thinned out, while Zed tried to save any familiar-looking soul that intended to enter the abyss."," friend plans to wash his old water bottle, ends up saturating the building with the aroma of year-old Thai tea and unleashing olfactory Armageddon.","[""It was never mentioned that the contents of the water bottle was year-old Thai tea, but very well could have been based on the description given in the OP. it's also vague here where this took place and how exactly the aroma was dispersed.

At first I took my boyfriends desire to help his mate out, as pretty considerate.

Without income they can no longer buy the products being manufactured, which in turn would cause product manufacturing to recede on all fronts.

For some reason, he can't understand this about me and continues to get angry that he buys me jewelry I don't wear, etc. etc. He just seems to not understand I don't want this type of typically ""nice"" gift. I still thank him for the original intent, but at what point should he start treating me as a person with individual likes and dislikes? He just expects me to like typical ""girl""  things. He's very upset with me and calling me ungrateful. Sigh. Maybe he's right. It's just something I will never be able to like but am expected to be grateful for anyway :/ \n\nAlso, I would understand if we just started dating, but it's been two and a half years of this. I don't want to lie to him about my interests though.\n\nHe is also trying to break up with me right now....but he does that every time he gets angry."," Boyfriend, after 2.5 years....still can't accept that I do not like jewelry at all.

The playground was surrounded by a row of hire huts that our school was using since the music area was being renovated.

How can I [30M] talk her down without looking cheap?\nMy GF recently became my fiancee.  I am sure she's been planning this day for a while in her head, but the only two details I've heard so far is that it is a ""$60k wedding"" and ""the groom/his family"" pays for it.  For reference, she is not from the U.S. originally (although she became a citizen in her teens), so her culture is weighing in here.  Her culture (middle eastern) is big on over-the-top events and the professional success to back it up.\n\nWe can technically afford this wedding, as between us we make about $300k/year, but I come from a lower middle-class background and spending $60k on a single event just seems preposterous.  It might even cause negative feelings with my family because no one has had a wedding that cost even half that much.\n\nThe problem is that I don't want to just say ""no"" because then I would look cheap.  I believe that she should get the day she wants, but I also think she could have just as great of a wedding on less (maybe $20-30k), so my challenge is to convince her that she could be happy, especially if it means we can keep it from impacting other milestones.  For example, she has already started talking about buying a house in the next 1-2 years.  Well, the average house exceeds $1 million in our area, so an expensive wedding is going to push that timeline back by a year or so if we are to contribute equally to the downpayment. (I'm 100% footing the bill for the wedding, remember).  We also both agree on trying to become financially independent of work as soon as possible, and are in general frugal people.  For example, we live in an old, cheap apartment, and she recently bought a used car.\n\nWhat can I do here?

She agreed not to contact him again and not to reply if he contacted her, which (apparently) he hasn't.\n\nThe problem is that she is now thinking of applying for her next temporary job and has already updated her CV with details of her last employer, naming this guy as a referee.  I'm not exactly happy about this because it could provide an excuse for him to contact her. Even if he doesn't contact her, writing a reference effectively gives him some kind of power to be helpful to her. (I know because I often write references for people at work.) This is a sensitive topic because apparently the main reason she fell for him is that he was soooo helpful at work.\n\nMy wife doesn't see this as a problem because the agent or new employer (not she) would be contacting him for a reference, and she thinks it would look strange/suspicious if she omitted this detail from her job application. I suggested simply stating truthfully that the name is omitted for personal reasons, but she thinks that would also look strange.\n\nWhat is the best thing to do in this situation?"," Wife had ""affair"" with former boss, regretted it and stopped contact, but now wants reference for new job application.

She's obviously sick of being cooped up, but for the most part has been entirely chill about the whole process, but I was expecting a bit of a backslide in her training. \n\nRecently (last two weeks) she's been barking at people she doesn't recognize when I'm walking her to the bathroom at night.  To be fair, this is a relatively new apartment/ area for her, and she's been laid up and hasn't been able to explore/ meet the neighbors.\n\n  It usually goes down like so: Milly sees a person in the distance and goes on alert (ears up, tail up, eyes focused). I usually at this point try to distract her with a, ""Hey, Milly, it's just our neighbor.  thanks for letting me know they are there!"" If they keep walking toward us, or we keep walking toward them, she usually breaks into the crazy greeting dance of her people (total wiggle butt, hoping side to side, ears up but relaxed).  We're working on a more relaxed greeting.  At this point I usually make her sit and stay by my side until she calms down.  \nWell, if they don't move toward us (fair enough when she's clearly on alert), or she isn't allowed to get closer/ investigate she will bark.  Not a low bark, but a higher ""hey, you! Friend?"" kind of bark.  At this point I say, ""enough"" sternly and work with her until she will heel beside me and then we sit calmly once she's away from the stimulus. Once she completely calms down and has listened she gets a ""thank you"" and a treat.  I have a feeling this will go away once she has a chance to run/ play/ explore/ say hi to the neighbors and get some energy out, but maybe not, and I would like to curb the habit of barking at people, especially because she is rather large (in comparison to most dogs in the building) and sometimes she barks at people that already seem afraid of her.", Dog barks at strangers usually just at night.

I have been lurking for a while.\n\nI've been with my boyfriend Alex for 12 months. We live together, and have a good relationship apart from little arguments about chores and stuff.\n\nLately he has been acting like we're not having sex enough. He will drop things in the conversation about how he doesn't feel attractive, and if his weight is a problem (it isn't, he's pretty ripped) and asks why I don't touch him more. Just general things like that. When I try to tell him I don't think we have sex too little, he agrees with me and acts like nothing is wrong, but in a way that tells me he just doesn't want to upset me.\n\nI do reject him 50% of the times he tries to start something. I have a weak immune system, and I get sick alot and don't really feel like sleeping with him. Another thing is I recently went through losing a 5 week old puppy I rescued and bottlefed to parvovirus. I don't want to bring this up to him because it will sound like an excuse, but I nursed that little guy and syringe fed him for 2 weeks and losing him really messed me up.\n\nI'm rambling a bit, so my main problem with him acting like this is I think we have sex more than enough. On an average day, we have sex 4-5 times in a long session, rather than multiple single times a day. I'm wondering if maybe he doesn't see it as much because it's all in one big chunk. I make sure we do it so much because I want to keep him satisfied, even if I'm not feeling 100%. I can't help but feel a bit unappreciated. \n\nMainly asking this so I can read your responses and see high libido perspectives, and so we can see what people think after we have a talk about it."," boyfriend doesn't act like we have sex enough, we do it 3-4 times a day on average.

Eventually everyone passed out after drinking heavily.   Fred woke up to Carl trying to take off his belt.  Fred shrugged him off and told him to go away.  He woke up that morning vaguely recalling the incident but he wasn't sure it was a dream or not. \n\nThe rest of the guys have similar stories, including alcohol and a hand down the pants or trying to take a belt off.  \n\nThe most recent person to come forward told a different story, where it was just 3 guys sleeping over playing video games and such.  The friend, Mike, said that none of them were drinking that night and he woke up with Carl's hands down his pants.  He told him to get away and spent an uneasy night awake.  Carl texted him later that day and asked him if he wanted to ""do anything"".  Mike says this incident happened a few years ago.\n\nNow, Carl doesn't identify in gay in any way, and he's had girlfriends before.

This was performed at a rural hospital, and poorly apparently. They told her that during the surgery, they accidentally nicked an artery or vein, and had trouble stopping the bleeding. The surgeon at the time told her that she had to use very large sutures, and following, she had bleeding for at least a couple weeks. Ever since then, she has had irregular bowel movements - in that, she is often constipated for days. Presently, she does show some signs of potential gall bladder issues, but the symptoms in question predate this by years. She has been dealing with abdominal pain and constipation since the surgery. I am wondering if it's possible that this surgical mishap could have cut off some blood flow to the intestines or some other part of the excretory system resulting in the symptoms... but researching this has been difficult. I understand medical terms, but my searches have mostly turned up home remedies for constipation. She has taken stool softener to minor effect, and magnesium citrate to almost no effect.

He was always really busy and I felt neglected, so much so that I ended the relationship. We had the best sex I have ever had in my life though. We've remained friends.\n\nThen I began to date this other guy, Tom. Tom and I were together for two and a half years. We lived together and everything was great until it wasn't anymore. He is 28 and I'm 25 and he just stopped being attracted to me I guess, because he would never try to sleep with me. I had to initiate everything and half the time he would reject me because he was on adderall or something. We didn't click sexually. In fact, when I told him how I wanted rough sex, he replied about how he ""isn't into rape"" and made me feel really shitty. I broke up with him last Thursday (it was very civil, he didn't try to get me to change my mind, it's very obvious he's no longer interested) and he is in the process of moving out. He's not staying at my house, he is just packing on the weekends (while i stay at my sisters) and should be out by the end of this weekend.\n\nI have been talking to my ex lately about my breakup and he's really been supportive. Not like a ""I want to get in your pants"" supportive, but just a really great listener. He's probably one of my best friends, but I really want to fuck him. In fact we've talked about it. Neither of us want to date again, we just both agreed it was like the best sex ever. My question is - do I go down the sticky friends with benefits road with my ex? I don't want to ""ruin"" our friendship, but we've already had sex before and I kind of feel like this would make our friendship stronger. He's the most open person ever sexually, we explore all kinds of fantasies. Of course I won't be sleeping with anyone until all of Tom's shit is out of my house because I need to make sure I close that door for real.

We kind of forgot about it and just checked last Friday (3/4) on the status, and USPS has the package marked as ""**undeliverable as addressed**"" on 2/23. There was no further tracking after that, so the USPS has no idea where it is and assume it was sent back to sender.  \nWe called the passport office and have been told a few things:  \n  \n1) Report the passport lost/stolen and request a new one  \n2) Report the passport as undelivered and let the USPS and passport agency attempt to track it down.  \n  \nI have also heard of success in going to a local passport agency and getting an expedited one, but you cannot get an appointment until 2 weeks out of traveling abroad. We still have like 4 weeks until we travel, so i don't know if the agency will see us, and i don't want to wait until the last minute.

It's not my business. However, she's promised me repeatedly that she's saving her money, and that became important recently when she lost her job. After that, it all came out of the woodwork - most of her savings are gone, some spent on her student loans, plenty spent on more useless shit and cheating on her diet.

A few months after the split, my ex felt he needed to ""clear the air"" so that we could have a chance at reconciling. That involved my learning I had been completely oblivious to cheating, lying, and an arrest (yup, he went to jail for a few days and I had no idea). I know what you're thinking, that I am just super dumb. I wish that was the case, I'm college educated and have a professional career, just plain old gullible. In the aftermath, I have spent a year having exclusive relationships, the next having one night stands, and the last online dating. For the record online dating does nothing to improve trust issues, I had on guy tell me he slept with Cameron Diaz and another try to steal a set of golf clubs (and those are just the gems). \n\nThis afternoon the guy I have been seeing on and off for the last six months finally agreed to keep things casual. Now, I am free to date and see whomever I choose, and am contemplating whether I want to go the online route again. My casual relationships thus far have involved ignoring lies because the details aren't important. This isn't one sided, I fib about where I am when I'm out with other guys. Unfortunately, when I notice them my history and fear makes ignoring feel self-deprecating, and I struggle to forgive myself for ages after the bad ones.  On the other hand, I am just not ready for the LTR I want, one missed text or phone call and I flip, but I'm not attracted to someone who caters to my every wish in the long term. So Reddit, I need suggestions on what to do next. \n\n- Side Note – During this last relationship I was in a place to tell my SO about how scared of lies I am and it got a lot better, so I know that in time it will get easier."," Super gullible w/ trust issues, not ready for LTR but casual involves too many lies, what direction should be next?","[""there's a lot of history being skipped here. but the general context is absolutely correct -the answers this summary will get will still align with what OP wants (even without the entire history being laid out)""]",0.7686948735598905,0.642808901830406,0.5488890963603816,0.9999999999999999,0.6025801195700533,0.19131953021422626,0.7298406778207086,0.9180818075352493,0.4538539291318455,0.0,0.2707640420284735,0.30514219860192426,0.1370676672477149,0.21304160742264777,0.053833209301549334,0.0417288910040616,0.3477949177205524,0.09205712705539161,0.0797930559755788,0.25598456066242026,0.09113806724349952,0.07516347939391688,0.4646546028445325

I need some advice for my dad on possible attorney extortion.\nSo I'll try to make this as short as possible.  My dad started a company the beginning of last year selling a bottle opener called ""MyTopOff."" (www.mytopoff.com  it's hard to explain what it does)\n\nHe ran a few television commercials last year and didn't have much success.  He has been doing a bit of online marketing and hasn't broken even yet on his investment for getting this all started.  He even packs and ships this product from his own garage.\n\nThe commercial for the product says ""buy one get one free"", but there's extra postage on the second item.  This is pretty standard on most commercials, and before someone checks-out online it clearly states the extra fees for the shipping on the additional item.\n\nMy dad received notice for a case that was filed by an attorney out of New Jersey (name withheld by me) who filed a class-action lawsuit against my dad because of the ""deceptive"" advertising.  Upon further research my parents saw that this attorney files about 100 cases a year against companies for this same thing; usually settling out of court for large sums of money.  This attorney ordered the product with the intention of filing this case, and I'm assuming the attorney keeps all the money he collects.\n\nMy dad ended up calling the attorney, and the attorney said this can all ""go away"" for $15,000.   The problem is, my dad hasn't even made $1 on this product yet, and is struggling trying to get his business going.   He called a couple other attorneys about this, many of them know who this bad attorney is.  If my dad tried to fight it, it would cost him approximately $10,000, and then it's a gamble whether he will win or lose.\n\nDoes anyone have any advice on what plan of action my dad could take?

Once I got to the Fortaleza airport the flight got delayed a couple of hours but the TAP staff guaranteed us that we wouldn't miss the transfer flight in Lisbon even though it would be a very tight time schedule. Once in Lisbon we (pretty much everyone who was going to Stockholm) ran to the gate just to be denied boarding under the excuse that our luggage wont make it to this flight so we couldn't board, when asked if they could just let us board anyway and then send our luggage the TAP staff girl just said they wont do it. We all went to the transfer desk, pretty upset, only to find a huge line of people from other flights already complaining about their situation. From the 3 attendants in the transfer desk, only 1 was working and the other two just calmly said to us ""We cant help you, you should get in line and wait over there."" There were pregnant women, people with babies, elderly and everyone stressing out because it has been over 2 hours and the line hasnt move a thing. Soon enough chaos starts and I hear the TAP woman screaming to a customer ""You shut the fuck up! And you too sir!"" (in portuguese). \n\nThats when I pick up my phone and start filming when a lady which was in line with us says: ""You better put that down, you dont have any permission to film here and if you continue, I am allowed to throw your phone away.""

At the end of the night she and her senior (A), who has a higher position, married with children, offered to walk her home. She agreed as she was a bit drunk at this point.\n\nPrevious to this she has talked about A as a mentor who has guided her through the new job an given her some good career guidance. Needless to say she trusted him as a friend.\n\nAnyway, once they were at her home he started making very aggressive advances including trying to remove her dress, kissing her & inappropriate touching. All the while she was saying 'Stop, this isn't right, you have a wife' etc. She made it quite clear about this. He continued and at one point he had removed his pants and was trying to get her to perform oral sex on him. Again she refused and he left shortly after. \n\nShe is extremely upset about this and doesn't want to report it to HR or the police as she doesn't want to relive it and would rather forget about it and try to move on, she believes this will give her closure. I can completely understand but to me the situation is much worse then she is giving off and this needs to be reported to their HR department at the very least.\n\nSince the night occurred she has only told a couple of friends (who do not know A) and me. One friend has told her not to do anything about it and says things like this happens, to me this is completely the wrong thing to say and trivialises the situation. \n\nAt the moment she is very upset and angry, (as am I, I feel by not being there I can't do anything) and would rather forget about what happened. I'm looking for a little guidance as to what I can do for her. Thanks.", GF was sexually assaulted by a colleague after a night out and is too upset/doesn't want to escalate it with the police/HR whereas I feel it needs to be.,"[""It didn't ask for advice nor say that the colleague was her senior.""]",0.7686948735598905,1.0,0.7602490078029613,0.9999999999999999,0.8036325642319357,0.5300263613667905,0.1606904414559908,0.8455014502741645,0.2609113258336069,0.0,0.7694494193378378,0.6605321734052758,0.3239928053358625,0.5085526706410253,0.2947985252475306,0.24857811498644103,0.7617769087341941,0.28364202662591714,0.25279976309868685,0.530260348232248,0.29816623698114464,0.2599594176070352,0.6878545568647594

The same is true for her fiance. I have nothing against them, but the only reason I would be going is for my wife.

I'm not sure. \n\nI am currently training for my first half- and full-marathons, in Chicago this September and October. I have been running consistently for the last few months. Maybe not as much as I should, but running 8 miles at 80 minutes was no problem and something I did a few times per week. I had a 14 miler that had some walking, and many shorter ones. \n\nTwo weeks ago I left to do some traveling. I packed my gear and intended to do some serious running while away. But I was quickly frustrated because I couldn't seem to run more than 2 miles without losing all steam. At first I thought I just had a bad day. But it's been two weeks now, and not once have I managed three straight miles. \n\nThese are all my guesses: \n\n1. Switched time of day that I run: I was running late mornings, early afternoons. During my trip, I had to shift to the early mornings. I figure this was needed anyway, since the half and full marathons are morning runs. \n\n2. Change of bed? \n3. Stress due to travel? This was all in the northern midwest, though, so I wasn't grappling with significant climate or elevation changes. \n4. Change of diet? I had been eating fairly lean before, but then was wiped out by a hard run for days at a time. A friend told me I should be eating a lot more. I increased my diet, and my running plummeted. \n5. Reduction in alcohol consumption. Yeah, this one is weird. I was drinking too much and cut way back, down to nothing for a week (which is a long time for me).

It seemed like somehow we were actually going to avoid a messy friends-with-benefits falling out of sorts.\n\nAnyways, she and I ended up having an open conversation about the possibility of dating. We decided that there was some stuff I had to take care of first, but we were both into the idea and agreed to be platonic friends until we would (really inevitably at this point) start dating.\n\nAnd then, a few days after that conversation, I got really, way too drunk and made out with one of our mutual friends.

Today my gf was out of town for something school related, so I hanged with my two friends.  I always gave Megan info like ""yeah i think ima hang with Julia and Hanna when you're out of town"" and she usually says something like ""haha okay sounds good.""  And I ask her ""you're fine with that right"" and she'd say ""With Julia? Ya of course."" There has been a few times where like we'd go to Spot coffee and get some food together, always the 3 of us (Me, Julia, and Hannah). I have always believed Megan had not cared... until today.  \n\nToday Julia and Hannah told me that Megan isnt always very nice to them.  Such as, giving ""looks"" to them in the hall.  Or not saying Hi if they see each other.  Apparently Megan only says hello and stuff when Im with her.  Anyway, I never knew this.  As I said, Megan always seemed perfectly fine with me hanging out with my friends.  In addition, she has a good amount of guy friends, so its not like she doesnt understand..

Fortunately I was able to cut off the water before any further damage could happen.  When I had a plumber come out to fix the pipes, he basically laughed when he went up to the attic and saw the plumbing system that had been installed by the previous home owner.  In the attic, there was a maze of exposed CPVC (no insulation jackets) pipes all through out the attic.  They were also raised about 2-3 feet in the air with NO hangers.  The plumber said it was basically a disaster waiting to happen and that the only real solution would be to have the entire attic re-piped correctly.  He said he could replaced the broken pipes, but it would just result in another break during the next deep freeze so we went ahead and replaced the entire attic and we are setup with a good PEX system, with a fiberglass insulation sleeve, and the pipes now run low enough to where insulation can be placed on top of it also so we should be good for the future.\n\nSorry, long lead up, but my question is:  Before we purchased our house in 2012, we had it inspected by a home inspector for $400 or so.  He provided us a pretty detailed report about some issues, but NOTHING was mentioned about the shoddy plumbing system that was just waiting to fail.  I went back and looked at the report again to confirm, but I also noticed that apparently ""Private Water systems"" are out of the scope of their inspection/report which I think is RIDICULOUS...  We were first time home buyers and needed an true professional inspection to let us know of any potential problems before purchasing the house.  Do I have any recourse with our inspector?  The plumbers and the insurance adjustor that have come out have both stated that they are amazed the house passed inspection with a water system like that in the attic.

One was an administrative job and the other was a production job. When I had called to question why they never offered those positions to me (I was very poignant and called the temp service twice a week to see what was available); they said that was just so that they could get people in to put in applications!

Lots of crazy shit has happened since then, and I will be on dialysis for the rest of my life. Part of managing this is going to doctor appointments in the local peritoneal dialysis clinic every three months. They do bloodwork, you meet with a dietician, you meet with a pharmacist, they check blood pressures and things, and you meet with a doctor. Takes about three hours. \n\nMy bloodwork has traditionally been shitty. My phosphorus, calcium, potassium levels have been all over the place. I was on 10 pills a day to manage my calcium alone. \n\nNow, on to the actual point of this post. \n\nAt my clinic appointment yesterday, I was informed that ALL of my bloodwork fell in the normal range. \n\nALL of it. \n\nI've been taken off more than 50% of my medications because I don't need them anymore. \n\nThe dietician/nutritionist (is there a difference? i don't know) was astonished. She said she was proud of me for making such a significant change through my diet alone. The doctor was impressed too, which really meant a lot to me because she's a very strict, no-nonsense type. She isn't the type to say something just to make someone feel better. \n\nAnyway,"," I went from 10 different kinds of pills + one weekly injection to manage my health, down to two kinds of pills + one weekly injection. plus my dialysis itself, of course, but that's never going to go away.","[""Says information not in the post.

There was no talk of a possibility of a future.\n\nThen she sent me a message telling me how much she missed me, how she wanted to see me etc etc. I called her and she started by telling me how sad she was to lose me, but now she knew how much I meant.

About 3/4 weeks ago she was not answering my texts or just being very aloof with me. When we met up at the weekend she eventually admitted that she has had depression before and is going through it again so she wanted to break up because in the past she has treated her boyfriends like shit during these periods and didn't want to do that to me. I said no, thanked her for telling me what was happening and then said we would get through this rough patch.  \n\nSo since then she has gone from texting me and talking throughout the day to maybe getting a text or two in reply to something I sent during the day. I know this sounds stupid but we have ended almost all of our texts for the past year with an ""x"" but she is even rarely doing that now. She is even purposefully ignoring texts as I get the read notification and if i get a reply it can be hours later.  \n\nOne part I can't understand is, when we are together at weekends things seem almost normal as she seems happy to see me, we hang out, sleep together etc.  \nWe even talk about possibly moving out together in the summer.  \n\nI know she told me she would be rough to deal with during this time but whenever I have asked whats up she says everything is fine.

What do?\nMy life is just (or at least seems to be) a lot harder than his.  My job is more intense and my boss a lot less flexible than his, thus I work more hours and get less vacation.  Although we have the same type of job at different places, mine just seems to come with more responsibility and more demands and expectations.  I am also pretty high-up in a field which is mostly men, and I feel I have gotten this far by always being better than the men to be considered equal.  I am also an only child taking care of my parents who are both ill.  Lastly, I pursue more hobbies and interests and social contact outside of just my boyfriend to feel fulfilled and satisfied.  As a result of all this, I am often tired and need a fair amount of care a support.  I don't get much time off from my job to recover, either. This imbalance in our relationship makes me uncomfortable, \n\nWhen this all started, I thought it would be a few months and then we would reach an equilibrium and maybe even he would have some problems and it would be my time to be the supportive one.

She said she's not sure about dating, although she admitted to being attracted to me, and maybe considering dating me in the future. \n\nI told her I couldn't wait around for her and that I also couldn't just be friends.

I told her I had some dates. She immediately seemed to get distant and cold, then admitted ""I'm a little jealous.""

What to do?\nMe [F21] and my boyfriend[M19] of 2 years and 7months have been having issues lately (some are small issues like we've had in the past, others are new ones that's starting to bother me).\n\nWe've been friends for a good 2 years before we started dating so we know each other pretty well. We may not have much similarities, but that's one of the reasons why I love him, because I learn so much from him. He's a gamer-geek and because of him I was able to try out video games that I never thought I would ever play (ie Skyrim) and movies I thought I wouldn't watch (ie Pulp Fiction, Ultramarines). \n\nI've never had any trust issues with him before and vice versa. We've never had this kind of issue before and I'm not really sure if I should be having trust issues with him. I guess I'm just worried because we're in a different situation right now -- I've already graduated and he still has about a year of college left. \n\nI know he has new friends, and I'm happy that he does but sometimes he sends me mixed messages. He would tell me about his friends and his day but I can feel that he holds things back, especially when it's about a certain person. I guess what really worries me is that he's the type of person that isn't aware of what he/she is doing. He wouldn't know that someone is flirting with him unless they tell him upfront and he wouldn't know that he was flirting back or entertaining other girls unless someone tells him. I've noticed him falling into a ""pattern"" when he talks to a certain girl, similar pattern when he was starting to court me. We started out as close friends, and I can tell that they're starting to get pretty close. Is this a sign?\n\nI'm not sure if this is just my imagination or I'm onto something. I love him very much.

I want to become closer friends with all of them, but don't know how to go about doing that.\n\nIn particular, one of them I can't help being drawn to. He's extremely passionate, and talented, and just amazing to talk to, and he and I are a lot alike. He's not the kind of guy I usually go for, and I'm not sure what it is about him that makes him stick in my mind so much, but I can't help thinking about him. \n\nMy problem is that he also got out of a long term relationship recently, I don't know how to get him alone without scaring him off, and I'm pretty sure he just sees me as one of the guys.

I apologize if this post is kind of all over the place, but trying to quick explain the situation. \n\nMy FH and I are both military (LDR for 4 years) and stationed at different bases.  We have been talking marriage for over a year, planning on doing a simple backyard ceremony within the next year or two.  Fast forward to recent times, and he has gotten overseas orders, leaving in fall of this year.  I am unable to go with him unless we are married.  \n\nTo top it all off, I was recently deployed for 6 months, and at the end of my deployment, my FH deployed to a different area.  By the time he gets back (late spring) it will have been a year since we've seen each other. \n\nAnyway, after discussion, we have decided to get married before he goes overseas.  Then, either I can try to apply to get orders with him, or I will be eligible to go be with him after my contract is up next year. \n\nHe is coming to visit me after he gets back from his deployment, and we have been discussing doing a court house marriage at that time.  The problem with this, is that both of our families would not be able to make it at that time (both his dad and my grandma are dealing with serious illnesses at this time).  We do not want to disappoint our families by getting married without them, but we absolutely cannot wait on the marriage due to the military. \n\nSo now for the advice....would we be terrible people for eloping/doing a court house wedding by ourselves....but only announcing engagement to everyone at that time?  We would plan to do a backyard wedding in fall before he leaves so that our families would have time to plan and be there.

I told him I wouldn't sleep with anyone else if he didn't want me to. He said over and over again how he didn't want to make me do something, but I told him I cared about his opinion.

Me [22M] and my [22F] ex girlfriend\nHey, first time post on here and I'm unsure how to handle myself.\n\nAbout last October (in 2013) I broke up with my long time girlfriend. We dated for about 6 years, throughout most of high school and a large portion of college. She was the first girl I dated and I really did care for her. I broke up with her because we were both abusive towards each other, physically (nothing extremely drastic but I have a scar on my arm because of her) and verbally.\n\nWe decided to stay friends after the break up and all seemed to be going well. However, I noticed that almost immediately (within like 2 weeks) after we broke up this guy she met from a club started hitting on her. She claims to have no attraction towards him but anyone with a pair of eyes can see there's a mutual attraction. Now I don't like this guy because he was hitting on her while we were still dating. I just got onto Facebook today to see her and a picture of him together celebrating his 21st birthday.\n\nI know I'm the one that broke it off and it's my fault for doing so, but I can't help but feel...betrayed? Is that normal? How should I handle myself? I feel like I want to punch something, as I still find myself caring for her, but that would only break my hand.

Is this a bad idea or could this work?\nIt's a very long story so I'll try to summarize and provide details when asked. We have lived together since almost the start of our relationship and have always been extremely close. One of our issues has always been sexual needs. We split up a couple of days ago over this because he met someone at work who he immediately wanted to fuck their brains out and felt guilty and like it wasn't fair to me.\n\nI explained to him tonight that every human in a relationship has these feelings at one time or another (correct me if I'm wrong). I too have wanted to fuck other people before but have never considered ending the relationship because of it. I feel like it's important these things remain sexual-only and no emotions involved which he has already stated would be the case with the current girl in question.\n\nHe also didn't have many other sexual partners before me so it's definitely coming into play. This situation is also something I have considered in the past without him (being polyamorous/non- monogamous-not sure?) We have also discussed threesomes and such before.\n\nThe reason none of it has come to fruition before now is because of my own insecurities with my body. I'm trying to reach the point now of knowing its my only body and working it. I'm in the process of losing 30 lbs and have lost weight since we started dating. My weight has always been a strain on my sexual confidence especially in bed with him. \n\nSo on one hand I feel mostly okay with letting him fuck other women (and me fucking other men when I find someone appropriate) but I don't want to be jealous. I have thought all of this out without getting emotional at all so it's all with a clear head. I want to have our amazing and awesome relationship as partners and still be open to other things. I also don't want to be completely neglected by him and find a balance of healthy sex and also occasional sex with others. Is this possible? \n\nIs this appropriate? Would I be better off posting this to r/polyamory or  something?, A relationship in which we can fuck other people is something I have always been interested in but I'm afraid of my own insecurity getting in the way.

I got on the Metro rail in downtown LA headed towards north Hollywood. I found a seat in the back.  Soon after the train left the station a commotion began near the middle of the train car.  A little old man in a suit was standing and yelling (in what I think was Farsi) at a middle aged guy who looked like a pimp who was sitting down.  He was wearing a lot of gold &  sunglasses & a flashy shirt.  Imagine the old man from 'Up' yelling at Samuel L. Jackson.  The pitch of the conflict was starting to rise and I sprung into action.  I immediately stood and walked directly to where the confrontation was taking place (I'm a big guy).  As I walked through the train car, I noticed a kid had begun filming the men on his phone.  When I got there, I stood across the train car from the two men and just stared past them and did nothing.  They both saw me approach and expected me to do something. I did nothing, but my presence was known.  The old man was seething and muttering under his breath.  The pimp looking guy was smiling.   After a moment, I looked the old man in the eye, and then the pimp guy.  The argument stopped and we all stayed there in silence as people came on and off the train, until the last stop.  It was kind of awkward and I wished one of them would move.  At the last stop I moved across the train to make sure they got off before I did.  In my head I was a train Marshall.

She said she has run some marathons and we chatted a little bit about how I was just starting to run. She told me about some of the runs in the area, how the best ones tend to end with beer, and overall was very pleasant and informative while waiting in line at the cashier. I definitely hope to meet more cool people like her while pursuing this sport.\n\nSo I got to the cashier and the 305 rang up at $160 as expected. I mentioned the web site price was $150 and he price matched it. Then I gave him the 20% off coupon and it wouldn't scan. He tried typing in the number and it wouldn't take it. So he tried again and it accepted the coupon, but didn't apply the discount to the 305. He read the coupon, looked at the GPS, manually entered the 20% off and had a supervisor approve it. Super easy, out the door for $120.\n\nThe coupon should work on any ""Garmin Fitness GPS"" (that's an actual category on the Best Buy website), as well as any heart rate monitor or other brand of fitness GPS.\n\nHere's a link to the coupon. Hopefully it will be useful for someone out there within the next couple weeks. It expires on 2/28/2011."," 20% off Best Buy coupon got me a Garmin Forerunner 305 for $120.

Need help making a decision [Housing]\nHello!\n\nI am currently renting an apartment in Philadelphia for 800 dollars and am planning to move out at the end of June (the end of my lease). Unfortunately, I made the great mistake of forgetting that there was a line in my lease that states it automatically renews unless I tell my landlord 60 days in advance that I will not be renewing. Instead I told him 45 days in advance. I was then told I am on the hook for another 12 months with an increase in rent (850) unless another person takes the lease.\n\n On the positive side, the real estate agency that works for my landlord is attempting to find a leaser now, but since the landlord wants 850 for the lease, it is proving a challenge for the agent to find someone. In the meantime, I've found a cheaper apartment including utilities down the street and already put a deposit down (685 for deposit + 345 for half month of rent). It should be noted that my current apartment is extremely expensive because of the inefficient heating (160/month in winter) and it's in a rundown old building.\n\nMy question is that if a person cannot be found for my current lease, does it make sense to lose my deposit at the other apartment complex and just stay at my current apartment? Or should I gamble that someone will be found by the agent in the next two weeks? Or should I pay a month of double rent in the hopes that someone takes the lease by the end of July. However, I cannot afford to pay the two leases at the same time for an extending period of time(poor, stupid grad student on loans).\n\nI understand that my woes are caused by my own mistake of not being aware of my own lease, but I am trying to rectify the situation now with your help. Thank you in advance, and please ask if you need more info.", auto renewing lease. I'm on the hook for 12 more months in a crappy expensive apartment. Already put a deposit on new cheaper apartment.

Here's a breakdown I'll try to keep as unbiased as possible.\n\n* We each paid $367.\n* The girl in the couple was preggers at the time.\n* I did not physically sign the lease because I had no means of transportation at the time. I sent them the money and they signed it. \n* The lease was for August through the end of April.\n* I stayed until January. An individual apartment that I had originally wanted and applied for way before I took the apartment with my friends opened and I took they opportunity because 1) They said they were fine with it and 2) They needed room for the baby\n* During my stay, the girl had a job some of the time, I had a job the entire time, and the guy didn't have a job because he played baseball at the university.\n*Also during my stay I paid for cable/internet to be installed and paid all of the cable/internet bills. They were ~$100/month. They paid for utilities (~$50 or less/month) and did give me some food from time to time. (They had food stamps). \n* I told them when I moved out if they need help, to ask me.\n* Found out today when checking about the deposit, they claim they had to pay $400 to clean the apartment (which was already pretty spiffy, just a few carpet stains), $100 for cleaning supplies, and the guy had to sell his car to make ends meet. \n\nWhat do I do in this situation? I'm in a bind where I need my money back. I also don't want to be a dick and make them pay me back. I don't know what to do."," Former roommates took my security deposit without telling me.

I had to take out the Government loans as well as private loans. I have a question about my private loans. As you can see here,  this shows my principal balances, interest rates, and current interest accumulated. \n\n The 13.250% loan has a fixed interest rate, the others are variable. I would really like to pay off both my private and government loans as soon as possible, and I am trying to figure out the best way to do it.\n\n I am a little confused over the wording of the paperwork I have on them. For the loan I took out in 2009, the wording about prepayment is ""Prepayment will not result in a penalty. If you choose to pre-pay, you will not be entitled to a refund of any loan origination fees or any finance charges accrued through the date of repayment"" Does this mean, if I were to pay it off, I would only need to pay the current interest and the principal balance? The paperwork says that I would end up paying around $19,344 if I pay it over the 15 years, but if I pay it off sooner, I would pay less?\n\nThe other 3 loans have different wording. ""If you pay off your loan early, you will not have to pay a penalty. You will not be entitled to a refund of part of the finance charge"". To me, that seems like, even if you pay it off earlier, you would still need to pay all of the interest that would have accumulated over 15 years. Are my thoughts correct? \n\nAlso, considering all this information, how should I go about paying back my loans? I have $27,000 in government loans, + interest, plus these private loans."," confused about the wording of my private loans, and want some help figuring out how to pay back my government and private loans.",['•phrasing and structure can be improved.

I respectfully act as a platonic friend to the girl i originally had feelings for, and to a lesser degree her boyfriend.

We have been meeting up to see eachother with other people around and she always kisses me, which i am loving.

We are definitely in the honeymoon phase and I am pretty sure I've never loved anyone as much as I love him. We worked together for 7 months before getting together so we had a long friendship that developed into a relationship. Back when we were just friends, my SO accepted a research fellowship in Germany. We live in the UK. We started the relationship knowing that we would have to do long distance, but it didn't seem like too much of burden because we were/are so happy. My SO went to Germany last week and is missing me a lot. The feeling is very mutual. \n\nFearing long distance, my SO applied for non-research post here in the UK and has gotten an interview. I am fairly certain he'll get the job and then he'll want to move back. I am not sure I want him to do that because he loves research and his fellowship is very prestigious. Having just finished his PhD, winning this kind of fellowship is almost unheard of and it's a chance for him to conduct his own research. In short, it's an amazing opportunity. The job in the UK is good money, it's in another department of where I currently work and it could lead to a senior management position, but I am afraid he'll only want to take it because he misses me. I also afraid giving up the fellowship will adversely affect his career in the future. \n\nI am so scared that he'll give up an amazing opportunity, move back to the UK and then once we've settled and the passion phase is over he will regret it. \n\nAm I going to ruin his career? I have never cared about someone else's happiness as much as I do his, and I really want to make sure that he is as successful as he can be both professionally and personally. I will support him no matter what, but I don't want to influence his decision at all. Is that even possible? Help?

We're both in the US going to college on opposite sides of the country. We were high school sweethearts and have made it through almost 2 full years of college. We have a very loving relationship and I'm very happy to be in a relationship with her. \n\nMy girlfriend (let's call her Sue) is in a sorority and is very active in it. She recently went to a dance they call Formal, and had a blast. It's custom to take a date to these things, and since I wasn't there she took someone whose friends were going but otherwise wasn't technically allowed into the dance. I didn't have a problem with it because I figured they would just hang out with their separate friend groups once in the dance. \n\nSue told me that's exactly what happened and how she even got stood up by the guy - he kind of just showed up with his friends at the dance instead of meeting up beforehand. I was glad she had a good time despite that.\n\nI just checked Facebook and Sue has a new profile picture. It's her and the guy from last night. She is laughing and having a good time, with her hands on his back, and he's doing a somewhat funny face. It's a cute picture, but for some reason her having another guy in her Facebook profile picture makes me uncomfortable. \n\nI scrolled through some of her other pictures and this guy turns up on more than one occasion, even before the dance. I want to ask her if it's the same guy, but she is currently in a dance *performance* (not the same as the Formal she went to last night) so she is unreachable. \n\nNormally I'm not very jealous at all, but seeing that picture just made me sad and feel like I was being replaced for some reason. \n\nMy question is, is there any reason for me to be jealous?

I initiated contact (I told her I didn't catch her name, because I was busy, and shook her hand and ""greeted"" her), I made her laugh, I suggested sushi to order (which she liked), I taught her how to use chop sticks (she said many have tried to, and she finally got the hang of it when I showed her. + a little more contact!), and helped her with a problem she was having at the moment (how to hook up a Nintendo through a VCR (text message)). \n\nOverall, I think I did well.\n\nProblem is, how do I see her again?

I made a myfitnesspal account, and tracked a typical day for me, with no changes. I was very, very quickly disgusted. I discovered two things that fascinated me. The first being, that I DONT over eat. I do however, drink incredible amounts of calories. I found I was drinking TWO THOUSAND calories on a good day. Well, clearly I've established what I need to change most, right? Right.\n\nThe next day, and every day since, I've completely stopped drinking soda, and went into what I believe was a sugar/caffeine withdrawal. Years of drinking hundreds upon hundreds of calories worth of soda has left me more than a little messed up. I allow myself 1 glass of coke a week, and so far this has kept off any cravings, yay! \n\nNow for the advice I need.

For example there was a girl a while back I was seeing and she kind of messed me about a bit, was rubbish at texting back, organising stuff, but usually when we were together it was amazing.\n\nAnyway, one weekend, I'd organised for us to go to the ballet and I was trying to make plans for what we were gonna do before/after and the day before I texted her asking what she fancied doing/what time she'd be free but didn't hear from her until 3 the following day, 2 hours before the ballet started. Anyway, she didn't really have any reason for not replying, nor did she really make much of an apology and it annoyed me. Consequently I couldn't really shake the feeling of being pissed off with her and so when we did meet up, I found it hard to act like I wanted to be with her. Kind of ruined the evening, and made things really awkward.\n\nSo I'm now seeing a new girl and I feel like this is going down a similar route.

I ended up with several relatively light scars on my forearms, belly, and upper thighs. Those ones are usually not noticeable and while some people point them out they're pretty easy to shrug off. However, I also have much deeper scars running up the entirety of my upper arms, and now that it's summer again and I'm going out in tshirts and tank tops, people won't stop asking about them. They're raised and heavy and very obviously self-inflicted. \n\nIt seems like everyone from my boss to my Spanish professor (in front of the whole class, which is what prompted this post) has pointed them out. Some people are nice about it, and of course some are really rude, but it always makes me uncomfortable because I just don't know what to tell them.\n\nI've tried covering the scars with concealer and followed some home remedies to make them less noticeable but nothing has really worked so far. I don't think they're going away any time soon, and I'm in the American south so it would be difficult to spend all summer in long sleeves or sweaters. \n\nI don't want to feel like my scars are something I should be ashamed of for the rest of my life. But I also don't want to be stuck explaining a very personal and painful part of my history to strangers all the time. With little kids I can spin some crazy story and laugh about it, with adults I usually tell them they're just old scars, but some people really won't take the hint. One of my coworkers straight up told me I was just looking for attention after I tried to shrug it off. But I don't want attention or pity or a therapy session with strangers; I just want to be able to wear short sleeves this summer.\n\nI guess I just don't know the etiquette on this. What can I say to people to let them know that while I appreciate their concern, I really don't want to talk about it? Or should I suck it up and stick with long sleeves for now?", People won't stop asking about the old scars on my arms.

I noticed it especially in the dark grey-brown ones, but in hindsight, maybe I had been handling the same mouse every time thinking that they were different.

How about if we [compare him to his brother]  At first we thought he was paralyzed, but it soon became clear that was not the case.  He could move his tail and his hind legs freely, but he didn't do it often.  When he did decide to move his legs, the movements were stiff.  He could curl his toes.  He used his whole leg like a flipper to push himself along the table.  We named him Forrest, after Forrest Gump, because he is a determined bugger who can't walk or do any mouse things as well as his brothers.  \n\nNow, he is one third the size of his family.  He developed slower than the others after day 12; his eyes opened about 4 days later, he took the longest to wean, and he is the least adventurous (understandably). \n\nAs with most random mouse pregnancies, there is a chance of the litter being a result of inbreeding.

We had been there before because we have excellent sexual chemistry, but the romance wasn't there for YEARS. Now, after a month, the first ex (Bart) and I exchanged letters and we agreed to a friendship, he started going to the gym with me and it was a really good. We both achieved long-sought goals of physical fitness and he was a good motivator. The past two weeks he's been getting cozier. Four days ago he came over and we finally kissed again and we had a loooong talk. I explained that telling somebody you don't love them, and wont have sex with them, isn't a real relationship. He had many many emotional outbursts in the past, which I explained were totally unacceptable. \n\nThen he pulled what feels like a high school girl move and opened up about a dark secret (long story is he was taken advantage of by a Sugar Daddy who helped pay for college expenses and it had repercussions that manifested as intimacy issues). I told him I didn't really give a shit about it. I also told him that I'd be open to another attempt at a relationship but I wont call him my boyfriend or partner until ""It damn well feels like it"".

I, in turn, enjoy trolling him back. Recently, he received a dare to post something serious to his facebook as part of a prank. The way the prank works is that if somebody messages you about the serious thing you posted, you are given something by them to post on your wall. The joke spreads around like that, and is sort of stupid in my opinion. A few days later, I see he has posted to his wall ""My Grandmother went to heaven today."" With the odd wording, and me hearing nothing of his grandma's ill health, I assumed it was another one of his prank posts to lure more people in to his silly joke. I thought it would be rather funny to mess with some of the believers in the comments of the post.\n\nI type ""Good riddance"" into the comments and, within seconds, I receive a reply from one of his friends I did not know saying ""That's horrible. Why would you say something like that?"" With a lack of better judgement, I decide not to hold back. I go on a rant spreading lies about his grandmother: ""She was a horrible person and a menace to society"", ""She even ran over my cat and never apologized"", ""I went to AssHat's house and saw alot of German WWII related items."", ""That monster was literally a nazi!"", ""She's scum of the earth and we're better off without her.""\n\nI felt pretty accomplished with my trolling, not even considering the possibilty his grandmother could have actually died. Later that night, I returned to facebook only to see my comments had been deleted, and AssHat's comment about the awful things I had said. Turns out his Grandmother had actually died that day, and I was the worst best friend in the world.

I have a bit of medical history to address super fast, but I'll split it up. Thank you in advance. ( F , 18 y/o )\n\nOctober 2015 I got my first UTI. They started to come back every 4-6 weeks. I was referred to see a nephrologist. He diagnosed me with kidney disease after having an ultrasound and revealing I have seemingly one kidney. Left has grown to compensate for the right that seems to have not worked since birth. Also had what they said to be a ""small stone"" in the right kidney.\n\nI had then been referred to see a urologist if I got another UTI within the span of the next nephrologist visit. Well, I got one again. So I had a scheduled visit there before the nephrologist.\n\nThat was around June, 2016. Not much longer than a month, I had gotten sick from what seemed to be a stomach virus. All the symptoms. Lasted longer than 48 hours, which was strange. I had two ER visits due to pain and what I thought was bloody stool. CT scan revealed a cyst on my right ovary but that wasn't made a big deal.\n\nThen a GI doctor referral. She scheduled a multitude of tests for me. My stool sample test came back positive with C. Difficile toxin B. I am now taking Flagyl for this. 500 mg 3x a day. I have an endoscopy and colonoscopy October 3rd.\n\nToday, I've had a bit of pain in my lower abdomen very similar to what I would say UTI pain. I've had burning sensations when I've gone to the bathroom, too. I'm a bit worried and was wondering if I should see my urologist.

One thing that bothers me sometimes is that I have been purposefully vague about my past relationships and I don't know if I need to open up to him and tell him everything. We are both quiet, introverted people that don't necessarily share every minute detail, so it hasn't been a big deal. \n\nI was in an emotionally abusive relationship in the past, and had a couple of short-term relationships after that where I was still emotionally unstable. I did some things I am not proud of (breaking up by no contact with one guy, dated another controlling man and then kissed someone else so we would break up) when I was younger. However, I've matured and learned about healthy relationships. I've been in 1-2 healthy relationships before I met my current boyfriend.

But both of them stopped seeing me after a few sessions because I seemed pretty well-adjusted and was capable of dealing with the issues. I got some good advice about accepting myself and having healthy habits (exercise, eating well, sleeping well, etc.) to cope, but otherwise nothing major. The message I took away was that the past is in the past and I should work on the here and now. \n\nMy question is, do I need to tell my current boyfriend the entire truth?

Last night (11/1) we got in a huge fight about me not changing and how our relationship won't work out and basically broke up over the phone. So in an effort to try and fix it I drove to her house. She told me how at the parties she went to that two guys kissed her. The first one she pushed away, but the second one I asked her if she kissed him back and she said yes and that she did it because it made her feel wanted, which I guess I haven't been making her feel that way lately. We cried, we talked about everything, we had great sex, and I stayed over at her house just to sleep with her and then snuck out in the morning so her parents wouldn't know.\n\nWe both obviously want to work things out but aren't sure if we should. I love this girl, but the more I think about it, all I can think about is her cheating on me, and more importantly, liking it. It makes me sick to my stomach.

How can I help with her depression from far away?\nI dated this girl for several months when I studied abroad. It was fantastic. Unfortunately my time abroad had a expiration date and we broke up just before I left. After trying to drastically limit our communication for several post break-up months, we finally admitted that we still very much had feelings for each other.\n\nThe first couple months of the long distance relationship went amazingly smoothly, but eventually I felt her start to draw away. We would talk and the responses would be more curt, and where we used to waste hours just incessantly texting back and forth, we eventually settled in to a likely more healthy, but slower pattern of communication. She also took to tweeting extremely cryptic things, while for the most part putting on a happy face during our communications.\n\nI deal with some insecurity and depression for which I'm supposed to be taking meds. And her changed behavior gave me some anxiety about the status of our relationship, especially because on facebook she maintained the same active social life, going out with her mostly male friends who had during my time abrouad made their dislike of me very obvious.\n\nHer distance and the tweets deviated enough from her normal behavior that I finally addressed it on Skype, and she eventually admitted that she had these intense feelings of depression and external pressure and was in therapy for her issues, but for the most part refused to elaborate beyond that. \n\nThis conversation happened maybe two months ago, and since then we've gone through different extremes, extremely close and upbeat to distant and withdrawn. I want to help and play a larger role than a supportive voice through her computer screen. I think she for the most part tunes out whatever affirming comments I give her. \n\nWe have days where things are incredible, but then she falls back into a depressive cycle and I feel like white noise against everything else. Are the strategies for reaching someone who can be closed off, especially considering that I can't be physcially there?"," Girlfriend is depressed.

At first I assumed it was from smoking (I'm not a heavy smoker, maybe a few a day for several years, with plenty of week-long breaks) so I quit. It  got better but not completely better, it was still visible in the back of my throat while the other wasn't. I went to the doctor who prescribed antibiotics (which didn't do much). She said there's no reason to do anything  about it unless it's bothering me enough to want surgery. I probably should've mentioned to her  that I smoke but I didn't think of it at the time. I highly doubt  it's cancer though, I'm young and healthy other than the smoking (I know that sounds ridiculous  haha)\n\nSince then, I've been an on-and-off smoker (mostly during exams or nights of drinking) and sometimes my tonsil is fine but  other times, like right now, it gets really swollen and uncomfortable. I know that I should stop smoking and that's the plan, but for now can anyone offer  any ideas as to  what's causing this? Or any advice on how to reduce swelling? I've tried  gargling water, vinegar etc. without much improvement.\n\nI should mention I've had tonsilloliths before but have not had any (visible/noticeable)  ones in probably over a year."," Tonsil has been swollen for the  past few years, gets worse with smoking.

We'd been together for about a year with an 8 hour time difference. He told me he couldn't handle being so far apart from me anymore and it was causing him a lot of stress. I felt the same way too; I had a lot of anxiety, and so we decided to stay as friends. We still talked regularly as if nothing had changed, except that we cut the ""I love you's"" and pet names. But 2 weeks ago I found out that he has a new girlfriend. I was more upset about the fact that he didn't tell me about it. I suppose because we were friends now we could talk about anything, especially about something as major as that. He said he was afraid to ""lose"" me if he'd told me.\n\nHe still talks to me regularly. I try to avoid him when I can now. I thought he'd rather focus on his new relationship, and so I started talking to a guy on Tinder. We'd meet regularly, mainly for sex. At some point I just forgot to check my phone so I was avoiding calls and texts from my ex. He then asked me if he'd done something wrong because he felt that I was avoiding him. \n\nWhen I told him I was seeing someone, he became really upset/jealous and even said that I deserve better than a guy who just wants to fuck me. We talked for 3 hours about this, and he admitted that he still has feelings for me, that he really loves me but the distance is holding us back. He said his girlfriend is great but not as ""amazing"" as me.  He missed the connection we had. I feel the same way. And now I think we're equally confused. We're not going to stop seeing our new partners because we'll just go back to square one.\n\nJust at a loss of what to do here. Should we go NC?

I have seen it with my own eyes, but I want to get this off of my chest.\n\nI was dating this girl for awhile, about a year and a month or two. We met freshman year of uni basically when I moved in and a month later we were going out. Because of this all of my friends are awkwardly her friends. Either way, when we ""broke up,"" but it was a soft break... I kissed her goodbye before I got on my train home from uni for winter break and she went home and is away this semester for an internship. \n\nThis semester has been hard because I tried talking to her online, not realizing that we were actually broken up for sure (not just breaking because of distance). At the same time she dumps more reasons on me as to why we have broken up. Throughout this I got aggravated, because she was not upfront when we broke up. So after telling me she needs sometime to find herself and be single (100% no ties to me). She gets an OkCupid and is now going out with a guy long distance at another uni in my area (Northeastern). Which completely contradicts the reasons she gave me for breaking up, besides the ones which point to me being a bad person.\n\nThis girl was always a little odd I suppose, but I really loved her. She broke up with me a month after we started dating, but I somehow won her back. She sticks with guys traditionally, but also is a little flighty and doesn't make solid decisions, ever (changed majors every semester or more)...\n\nIt has been 4 months, I am still not 100% over her and she is coming back to the area for the summer (I am staying in the city this summer).

If you do the math, (sunday+birthday+just-moved-in girlfriend) you can see why I was expecting some sex.\nSo when I heard ""Happy Birthday"" and I saw my girlfriend with a really naughty lingerie, I was pretty happy. Anyway, we get going. It was the best sex we had ever had. I saw she was about to have an orgasm, so I started going faster. When she reached the climax, one of her leg started shaking. I'm not gonna lie, it was really hot and I felt like the god of sex. I was basking in my abilities, when all of a sudden \n\n**""MEEEEEOOOOOOOW""**\n\nIt was incredibly loud and it scared the crap out of us. Apparently my gf had kicked over a lamp with her leg, and that cockblocker of our cat decided *that* was the perfect time to crawl out the bedstand he was hiding under. The falling lamp knocked him out. He wasn't moving at all, so we got up and started dressing. While my gf called the vet (who thankfully is a close friend and lives quite near), I checked the cat: i could feel his pulse, so I put him in his transport cage and then we rushed to the car.\nHalfway there, and, thank God, the little bastard woke up with the cutest meow.\nWe arrived at our friend who checked him and reassured us everything was okay. My girlfriend spent the rest of the day hugging the cat and crying.

Studies generally find the number to be between 20 to 30 percent, but in 2011 the number went down to 14%. If these people are so armed with expertise and knowledge, why do people who don't understand anything about financial theory get more just by passively investing in an index fund? If anything, financial ""knowledge"" seems to do more harm than good.\n\nWhen looking at the stuff they teach in universities, you have to wonder how they keep on believing these theories despite the mountain of counterevidence. Stocks are assumed to generate returns relative to risk, quantified as beta in CAPM. Yet, beta has had almost zero correlation with stock returns starting in 1982. If you look at the studies that confirm beta's predictive power, they all used data from the 1970s. But people still use beta to create portfolios.\n\nHow about efficient market theory? Under the theory, stock bubbles should not exist since everythingn is properly priced. But they do exist. Instagram valued at 1 billion despite having no revenue? Definitely properly priced.\n\nEven option pricing models are ridiculous. One model assumes that you can borrow money at the risk-free rate and stocks only generate risk-free rate returns. The black-scholes model also assumes that risk is normally distributed, without looking at historical data, leading to black and scholes' own bankruptcy. \n\nWanna know how we price stocks? We pull magic numbers out of our asses and make it interact with other equally bullshit number to come up with an arbitrary value. Then we try to convince other people that our bullshit is, in fact, legit. The only way stock valuation models are accurate is if stock analysts are clairvoyant and can see 10 years into the future. But even then the analyst won't have to calculate anything and just tell us the stock price.", Financial theories need supernatural clairvoyance and are based on arbitrary assumptions that ignore real world and data.

She never really did alcohol or any drugs before this to much of any extent but this time she went way farther than she intended and ended up getting very crossfaded.

She asked him what had happened and if they even used protection but he wouldn't admit to anything. He wouldn't even say that they had sex. Soon after rumors circulated as they do in high school. She was always known as being incredibly innocent, hell she is a pastor's daughter, but now guys started asking her out of the blue if she would have sex with them if she was drunk. Also rumors got out that she was pregnant (she wasn't).\nAll this had a devastating impact on her self esteem and ego, meanwhile her boyfriend had gotten seriously depressed and was absolutely intolerable to deal with. The guy from the party started talking to her again. They met a few times under different circumstances, he would get her drunk, and have sex with her.\nShe left her boyfriend and soon after stopped seeing the other guy too.

There are a couple of reasons why this is weird to me.\n\nFirst, we've been friends for about 3 years, and has never seemed interested in me. When I first told her about my crush on her, she got really distant, and it took a while just to be comfortable around her again, but now our relationship is as strong as ever.\n\nSecond, she's really involved with another guy, who I personally think is below her standards. However, I try and stay out of the relationship as much as possible and just let them do their thing. However, she has gotten more and more flirty with me as she has been dating this guy.\n\nShe is very, very uncomfortable with touching other people, but recently (as in last weekend), began to put her arm on my shoulder, tickle me, hit me playfully, and is allowing me to do the same. This morning in class, i was tickling her, and she was perfectly fine. Then another of her friends put their hand on her shoulder to ask her a question, and she freaked out.\n\nI've also noticed that she has started talking really quietly around me, forcing me to move my head in closer so I can hear her. When I do this, she flits her eyes between my eyes and my lips. I've also caught her looking at me from across the room quiet often, and even though we are good friends, she looks away as if she's really shy or embarrassed.\n\nI think she may be developing a crush on me, but maybe I'm just becoming really close with her, and she is just becoming more comfortable with me.

Also, if it becomes obvious that she does indeed have feelings for me, is it appropriate to make a move while she is with this other guy (their relationship is about 7 months now)?"," Old friend is being really flirty with me.

Thanks.)\n\nSome background information: Over the past 4 months or so, I developed what I thought was a pretty close friendship with a girl whom I had known for the majority of my life, but had never really taken time to speak with until this year. In that time I discovered that she was an absolutely awesome person; very smart, and very funny and just enjoyable to be around. Up until just a few weeks ago we would talk for 3-4 hours a day on Skype, and I enjoyed all of it.\n\nNow onto the problem: In the time I spoke to her, she mentioned Prom on several occasions, asking questions like ""Do you know what day Prom is"", also mentioning the occasion when other girls post dress pictures to Facebook, making it a semi-frequent topic for short amounts of conversation. Now I, lacking minor social skills, came to the conclusion that these were some kind of hints, and decided to man-up and ask her. After a relatively simple outing, on the way back home I decided that I would ask, and she proceeded to turn me down. In all honesty, getting turned down is not a huge deal, it is what follows that bothers me.\n\nSince that day, she has not spoken to me at all, it has been 3 weeks now. She wouldn't return any of my texts (all three that I sent over those weeks), removed me from Facebook, and then removed me from her Skype contacts. She avoids communicating with me in person, and appears to avoid me now. There is nothing that I would want more than to continue on as we were just several weeks ago, but she appears to want none of it. I think I may have overstepped my boundaries in asking her to Prom, but being completely put out in the cold like this seems ridiculous, and frustrates me to no end.\n\nMy question is whether I should attempt to repair what I thought was a excellent friendship, or should I just try to let her go?"," Asked a close friend to Prom, I was turned down, now she won't speak to me; should I try to fix what is broken, or just let her go?","['The summary differs in meaning when said ""close friend"" rather than ""a girl"" ']",0.5618820640879507,0.642808901830406,0.5488890963603816,0.9999999999999999,0.5650187248102496,0.9380224041262748,0.0,0.945875276129788,0.4013362950382191,0.0,0.5129156945623874,0.4958446907218974,0.23593207421941464,0.37127590876654715,0.2553139586512658,0.21426594860591378,0.6711391859807043,0.21461196096646887,0.19032040539745312,0.42538890800900414,0.26878018551499117,0.23334202009585103,0.6540363820132098

She is very inconsistent and I don't feel like she communicates with me as her boyfriend. Occasionally she'll call me 'hot stuff' or 'babe' but usually it's 'dude' or 'man'.  Her inconsistency in communicating makes me feel like she is not taking this seriously, or making an effort. Sometimes I worry that there is someone else and I asked her once but she said no. I want to trust her, but given my past experiences it is difficult. Especially with the lack of communication on her behalf. Sometimes I think she's just worried we're going to run out of conversation topics and that's why she replies so sporadically. \n\nAm I overthinking this? Is this normal in early phases of relationships, especially long-distance ones? Maybe I'm just used to clingier girls? \n\nAny help, advice, or input is greatly appreciated!!!\n\nThanks guys!", GF is very inconsistent in communicating. I'm afraid she's cheating.

The other day we were talking about how well we get along and our preferences in the opposite and we both sorta match each others' criteria. She also complained how nobody has taken her on a proper date before & how she's been messed about in relationships in the past...However, she will suddenly stop replying part way through conversations then either reply the next day or not at all. I'm finding it rather confusing.  \n\nWe decided we would hang out properly for the first time tomorrow. I really don't know how to take this or what I should do.

What do I do?\nHello, all. I just recently got out of a long term relationship of 5 years. My ex and I used to attend the same university, but I got into med school and since moved away. The distance was rough on us, and it led to a lot of changes on my end. In the end, we decided to end it and did so amicably. When we first broke up, I asked that we remain friends and still update one another one each other's lives. At first, I thought that I could easily fall back into being friends with him, but I realized that it was too painful to talk to him or text him and be reminded of the end of the relationship. \n\nA few days after the break up, he called me, and I didn't pick up because I knew it would be too painful to speak to him. I sent him an email explaining that I wanted no contact for a little while so that we could both heal from the break up. I did have nothing from him for a day or so, but this morning I woke up and saw a text from him wishing me luck for an upcoming test. Seeing the text made me sad and a little upset that he is unwilling to respect the no-contact rule that I requested.\n\nI think that he continues to reach out to me because he doesn't have as good of a support group as I do (family and friends who support me and check in on me periodically), and for the past 5 years, I was that support. So, he is reaching out to me, but I don't think that reaching out to me will help either of us heal. I don't want to be mean and ignore him especially since I still care for him, but at the same time, I told him that I needed distance and time and no contact through texting, calling, etc. What should I do?

He was married again within 1-2 years.  They speak very rarely.\n\nThe issue is this: she is very depressed and can't move on with her life.  She's relatively functional in her professional life, but she's made it clear she misses having someone to talk to the way that she talked to my dad (both are very smart people, and she has a hard time getting that with her friendships and colleagues).  She has a tendency to drink too much and I catch her with 'bummed' cigarettes.  She's made a few attempts at online dating, but has always found her dates to be dull or socially inept or uninteresting.  Personally, I think the problem stems from the fact that she has been with my father since she was 19 and therefore never had to develop dating skills...she's probably shy and would rather avoid it.  Not to mention that exuding unhappiness makes you a pretty dull date!\n\nI'm worried because I'm moving to a different state soon and I want her to be on an upswing before I leave.  She's halfheartedly tried therapy and stays on antidepressants for a while but it never seems to go anywhere.  I think the bottom line is that she's unhappy, has low self worth, and is exceedingly picky about men.  What can I do to move her in the right direction?  I know that this has to come from within, but it's driving me insane watching her wallow in sadness.  I want to be sensitive but it seems so obvious she just needs to toughen up, put herself out there, and realize that she deserves happiness!", Sad mother divorced 3 yrs ago.

I love him, but I'm not in love. \n\nThere's no romance. He always gets upset at me for things that shouldn't be an issue at all (like wanting to go out and have a girls night). He spends his days sleeping and playing video games, he has no interest in working or working out or taking care of himself (or me). I feel like I'm scared to do anything because he always finds reasons to yell at me. I'm just not happy. He has told me multiple times that he doesn't trust me, and to a point I think he is very controlling (or tries to be). \n\nIt's hard. We live together, and have spent 99% of our time together for the last two years. I love him, and he loves me, but I just can't do this anymore. I need to experience being single and doing my own thing and having freedom. Maybe I am making a mistake and maybe I will regret letting go of someone who loves me, but the fact that I can't get these thoughts of breaking up out of my head is a big sign. \n\nWhat do I say?

People are now recognizing my weight loss and I'm not even half way into my journey. The act of people telling me on a regular basis that I look alot better has been giving me some motivation...but it's been giving me something else. Deep in my mind it's been giving me the idea that if I get satisfied with the compliment...if I say ""Thanks! I've been working out"", that I'm going to feel like I've achieved my goal.  \n  \nLosing fat, to me, has been an asthetic goal all along. I wanted to be seen as something different than just another fat guy. It feels great to be able to run a mile or to see yourself lifting more weights than some other guys in the gym (you know it's true). But when it comes down to it, it's just been about how people see me. Getting this positive attention is what I really wanted. Now that I'm getting it, I feel that I'm going to lose some of my motivation.  \n  \nMy stats are SW:335, CW: 290, GW: ~210, 6'0. I've been at this for almost three months now and I feel that this is going to be the deciding point. I can either slip back to where I started, or be a man and push through until I'm satisfied with myself.  \n\nThis is mainly just me venting, I'm sorry to bother with my insecurities. I don't really vent to anyone so at some points it has to go somewhere. Have some of you been in a similar situation?

Pretty sure he (24/m) liked me (24/f)\nSo I do bar promotions and I was working one night when I ran into a friend of my ex-boyfriend. He asked me to hang out with him after my shift. We talked, we danced, we drank, and we kissed at the end of the night. Given he said ""it feels wrong,"" but he still kept his hands around me. We exchanged numbers. He texted me two weeks later and we got together with my (not mutual) friends. This time he kept his hands to himself. We talked a lot and the flow of the night felt good. We hung out and talked some more. We've been friends for over a month now. While I was with my ex-boyfriend, we never communicated. Pretty sure I only saw him once or twice. Today, I worked another promotion and he came to see me . He came alone, ordered a drink, and waited for my shift to be over. We took one of the bottles and laid around in the woods. I really like him by now. Im obsessed with when we're hanging out next. I brought up a talk about my feelings. He said I'm a really nice gal, but I'm also the ex-girlfriend of one of his really good friends and that he doesn't want to cause problems and if roles were revered, he wouldn't want his friend with his ex-girlfriend.

My dog (whose previous issue was ankle-biting) is a 2 or 3 year old lab/basset hound cross. She was adopted from a shelter and has some separation anxiety issues (which we are dealing with), and is generally very very needy.\n\nThe trouble I am coming across in recent weeks is this: She sleeps in the bedroom, as she will NEVER be in a different room from me by choice, in her crate beside the bed. (Not closed in; that is just where she likes to sleep.) As soon as it is even sort of light outside, she begins pacing around the bed and whining incessantly.\n\nAt first I stuck with ignoring her and waiting for her to settle down and then giving her some attention (I didn't have any treats on hand, though maybe keeping some on the nightstand is not a bad plan). The trouble with that method is that she never actually settles down. She just gets increasingly louder until it reaches the point where she is flat out barking and howling.\n\nI am concerned about this because when I do finally get up (as I have no choice but to do), I am probably indicating to her that whining and barking is the way to get someone out of bed. I know it is not a case of having to go outside, as she calms down immediately when someone gets up.\n\nI am at a loss about the cause of this and how to fix it. Any insight would be much appreciated!"," Dog whines like crazy at dawn and just gets louder when I ignore her. I have to get up, but I think this encourages her to whine.

I'm not threatened by her and I know nothing would ever happen. What I am mad about though is he hasn't done anything like that for me in a long time.  I moved a couple months ago and he didn't lift a finger or offer to help.  This situation just leads me to thing about other things like how he'll go on trips with his friends but not me even though I always talk about wanting to go certain places and suggest we plan it out.

In spite of my desire to do so, I find it really difficult to sit down and really put all my effort into one thing -- maybe due to boredom, laziness, or short attention span. For example, I've been playing guitar for about 8 years. I'm good, I know I'm good. But I'm not NEARLY as good as I should be after 8 years. And its because I never truly dedicated myself to it. Even though I love it, I never had the ability to say ""fuck school/work/friends, I'm just gonna sit and practice guitar for 2-3 hours per day"".

Maybe it's just the personality I was born with. \n\nAnyway,", I don't do anything exceptionally well and that's kind of a bummer.

I visited once and it was great meeting her family and friends and I'm looking forward to seeing her again this Tuesday.\n\nAnyway...this is only my second relationship and my first was awful because my ex was very manipulative and cheated on me twice and unfortunately I let her walk all over me because I thought I was being ""nice"". That one lasted for about a year. I never did anything to wrong my ex and she always talked about how I was ""the best bf ever because I actually treated her right"" and then shit happened anyway...this has kinda made me a bit worried about things with my current gf for no reason.\n\nWe've only known each other for a few months but we're already very comfortable together and act weird all the time and it's great. I was very hesitant about things with her because I consider her ""out of my league"" but apparently she's actually attracted to me (I wouldn't say I'm very attractive) but the biggest thing I get from her friends is that I'm actually a nice guy unlike previous bf's.\n\nThe problem is that I get these irrational thoughts of her cheating on me (since I'm not around during breaks) and I get depressed and everything just seems so difficult. It's not like ""she hasn't texted me back in 10 minutes...she's cheating"".

Who finds replacement?\nHello,\nI don't know if this is so much a legal question or more of a responsibility question- So I moved out of my studio last month paying $650 per month in Chicago. I moved down the block to someone off of Craigslist because I thought the place was great. A house in a city with a porch! I love porches! But living there for a few days, I found that I didn't inspect the place well enough- the place is pretty ratty for a number of reasons, and my roommate doesn't seem that motivated to make improvements. He's a nice guy, but not really the cleanest. The situation is kind of awkward since when I brought up making improvements or contacting the landlord, he didn't seem that enthusiastic and basically responded that the landlord was unlikely to respond to fixing our broken sink and things like that. Well anyways, I found a much cheaper place ($300 cheaper per month! It's just not nearly as convenient a location: 2 miles from train instead of a block). But the people are already my friends and I think I could be a lot more relaxed there. The newer place would actually feel like my place instead of living in someone else's place.\n\nMy question is this- since my roommate described it as a month to month deal, here are my questions- \n•	Whose responsibility is it to find someone to take over my room?\n•	How much advanced warning should I give my current roommate without making this too weird? Immediately?\n•	Should I tell him I'm leaving cuz the place sucks or should I say I found a much cheaper living situation?\n•	How can I protect myself in this situation?\n\nI literally have not signed a thing and my name is not on anything. That may have been really irresponsible since  I don't really have any protection but I don't have any responsibilities either necessarily.\n\nIf I posted in to the incorrect subreddit, lemme know.\n\nAny advice would be helpful. Thank you!"," Moved in at beginning of September to month to month rental place without lease, decided I'm moving out end of September. who's responsible for finding new tenant- me or other roommate whose lived there whole summer?","[""Says information not in the post.

Am I a failure?\nI graduated in 2013 with a BA in Political Science. When I started college I thought I wanted to go to law school, but I realized that I only wanted to attend law school for my parents. Then I thought I'd want to pursue a career in international relations or something like that, but I just didn't want to go into more debt with more school. About a year after I graduated, I started to work as a substitute teacher, so I figured I'd pursue teaching. While getting into an alt cert program, I started working at Ross (the store) in October of 2014. While at Ross, I had so much pressure on me to find a teaching job with health insurance. Fast-forward to August 2015, I finally got a teaching job! But that job was hell on earth. I suffered from anxiety and panic attacks, so after two months, I had to quit. I went to a therapist (which I'm still seeing) and I'm doing much better, so now I have a job at Sears.\n\nI'm thankful for my job, but I'm 25 going to be 26 in May and I'm still living with my parents. I've been trying to save money, but I have a $450 monthly bill that I have to pay for that alt cert program. Luckily, May will be the last month I have to pay on that. I've been trying to apply to teach English abroad, but I just got rejected by EPIK, so I don't think that's going to work out.\n\nI just don't want to work in retail anymore.

When we were younger it was fist fighting and as we got older it became more verbal. My sister is very manipulative, my parent even admit it.

She has hacked my email, puts her friends before me, talks trash about my husband and kicks me when I am down. She is constantly trying to find ways to be superior to me.

I would get mad at her for always delving WAY too deep into everything we ever talked about.

I told her that was fine, I would just stop talking to Girl B, again purely as a friend. My ex then got mad at me for ""still wanting to be friends with  Girl B"", and threatened to break up with me so I could ""Finally go be friends with more people."")

She now has a boyfriend, I think. \n\nAnyways, I went through his phone to find a skype message with this girl. He always said he'd never respond to her and that she was annoying and clingy.

He said to her that I was ""kinda his girl thing but not really because he is afraid of commitment.""

It would have made since maybe 8 or 9 months ago, because that's what he would tell me. But it wasn't. It was from not even two months ago. He told me he loved me then, and told everyone I was girlfriend then. There was no confusion in our relationship then.

We set her up in the bathroom because we thought the small space would make it easier for her to transition. So now the problems, she only sits by the toilet when my Fiancee and I are around; She eats in front of me but only if I place the food in front of her and only stands up after extensive petting. She will immediately sit after I'm done petting as well. She's extremely jump and the tiniest noise causes her to curl into a ball and hide her head behind the toilet. She doesn't play, at least not with me, and a laser pointer causes her to go stroke mode and again, hide her head behind the toilet. She doesn't hiss at anything that I've found out yet.. So my question is, does my cat just need more time to get used to her space, and what can I do to get her to come out of her shell? Her history at the shelter says they found her as a new appearance in a Feral colony, so they thought she was a stray. I don't think she's feral because she lets you touch her (not pick her up; and bring your face even close to her is a nono...) She also hasn't tried to escape the house...or leave the bathroom at all (except one night when she tugged my electric shaver down and it caused her to run laps around the house."," Adopted a shy cat who is the biggest wuss I've ever met, I don't think she's feral, need HALP.","['Accuracy points are off for ""adopted a shy cat who is the biggest wuss"" and ""HALP"", both are compatible.

Should I be upset about this?\nI'm a Folklore and Arts Admin student, and I frequently takes classes where I have to use my Wordpress blog for assignments.  Last year I put together a fairly comprehensive ['field guide' about lolcats]  About two months ago, I started noticing a bunch of hits on the lolcat guide.  I got bored one afternoon and decided to see how quickly I could find my guide using Google, and I came across [this guide]  Some of the language and topic pages seemed similar to mine, but I figured that there's only so much to be said about lolcats, so some overlap was natural.  That was about a week ago.\n\nJust now, I checked my blog stats again, and I've had another spike in activity on the lolcat page.  I went back to the guide on the other site, and they've added new pages to their guide, which have even more similarities to mine.  I wouldn't mind if it was just the images (obviously I found the lolcats I used through Google and whatnot), but I feel like this person is using my words as well.\n\nSome of the pages on their guide appear to have been up long before mine, but they've been making a lot of changes and additions recently.  All I really want is that, if they are using my guide to supplement theirs, they at least include a link to my guide or a reference somewhere.  I worked on it for months, and it was the foundation for a paper about lolcats that I presented at a folklore conference this Fall.\n\nAt the same time, I can't help thinking maybe I'm just over-analyzing this and I should just be glad people are enjoying my field guide?

He's sweet, caring, tolerant, liberal, basically every single thing on my 'checklist', if I had one, is there. \n\nThe problem, though, is he talks VERY slowly. I mean his speed is really slow. If I ask him anything, he takes about 3 seconds before he starts to talk, then when he starts, the words go at a very slow pace,and he even pauses for 3-5 seconds in the middle of his sentence. I get really impatient and sometimes just feel like telling him to hurry up (of course I don't, but I really feel like doing so). \n\nI asked him today, very gently, why he spoke so slow, and he said he just gets thoughts very slowly in his brain. He then went on to say he's just generally slow at thinking. I felt really sad when he said this, I don't know why. He's a Math PhD student,and we are at a pretty good school, and his research has been going slow for a while now (but this is totally normal in grad school), so I think that response was kind of a self-deprecating one since he's already low on self-esteem. \n\nAnyway, my point is, his speed of talking is just a part of him, it can't be changed. I love him so much otherwise but I just want to know how to deal with this. Conversation is so important in a relationship! How do we manage?

Help!\nI'm coming to you with a weird problem which has probably occurred before. However, I am curious to see what others think about this problem, and if anyone has any tips for dealing with it.\nA few months ago I had a falling out with someone I considered a great friend. I won't really go into details other than to say that we were both at fault with our shitty behaviours. Nevertheless, I am trying to put this episode in the past. However, we are no longer friends at all anymore.\n\nHowever, we have a lot of mutual friends. I have purposefully kept quiet about the situation to avoid drama, but my former friend seems to have been gossiping to her close friends about me. So it appears that there's a whole group of people who think I'm not worth being around.\n\nNormally that wouldn't annoy me, because I have a lot of good friends and not a whole lot of free time due to my job, career prospects, etc. However, I do occasionally have to see this former friend at parties. Usually her group of friends is with her and I can't help but feel anxious when I know I'm going to be seeing her. However, these gatherings are the only times I get to see some of my other friends, so I don't want to avoid them altogether.\n\nHas anyone ever been in similar position here? How did you deal with it? I have a feeling that even if I try saying a polite hello, my former friend will just ignore me. Should I even try to be polite? I want to avoid awkwardness but it's difficult when you have mutual friends who don't know what happened. But I can't help but feel really keen anxiety when I think about having to interact with her. I really don't want to, but I want to see my friends. \n\nDo you recommend talking to my friends about what's happened, or just staying quiet for now?

She plans to get her masters in Business Administration starting fall 2017.\n\nFinancial Situation:\n\nShe needs to pay off her car with monthly payments, pay off student loan, and possibly her sister's financial needs. Her family may not be able to support her 13 year old sister, as the parents are getting sick. They might move out of country if they cannot work.

Me and my girlfriend had recently just moved in together and had sat down to watch a movie one night. A little ways into the movie she decided it would fun to start tickling me, I'm extremely ticklish so it didn't take long for things to go horribly wrong. I was laying on my stomach and she went for a spot on the back of my leg and in my panic I swung around and managed to knee her in the face.\n\nMostly stunned at first and in some pain she shook it off and we continued to watch the movie, until she noticed a clear like fluid dripping out of her nose. So we went to the emergency room to have her examined and what the fluid turned out to be was cerebrospinal fluid. So the fluid surrounding her brain was leaking causing it to sink on her brain stem and she began to have low pressure headaches.\n\nThey put a drain into her spine to help relieve pressure off of the leak in her skull, but during the procedure the tech had missed his entry point and had mistakenly herniated one of her discs. As a result of this two of her vertebrae collapsed and are now putting pressure on a nerve. It has been over four years since that has happened, she has had a surgery to fix her collapsed septum, and will have several more procedures placing localized pain killers on her nerve endings to help her sciatica she now has as a result of the pressure from her vertebrae. Once they have the sciatica under control they will prepare her spine for surgery and begin the repair process on her vertebrae and herniated disc."," girlfriend tickled me I kneed her in the face collapsing her septum and causing a cerebrospinal fluid leak out of her nose, still dealing with problems four years later.",['Summary looks good.'],1.0,1.0,0.9999999999999999,0.9999999999999999,0.7553443359075438,0.5893755589189569,0.5140567471071004,0.5711799616256492,0.3465663194629378,0.0,0.309178282940489,0.5858855549889963,0.4016716257205388,0.5047736253562647,0.3299284255882181,0.2864450853530246,0.5172823841531915,0.37851744735373927,0.3439367948808459,0.5785832248329938,0.31670723073809526,0.2836306861666873,0.5234282584486046

Back when we were in high school i always considered her a friend and liked her a lot, but strictly as a friend, she had boyfriends and stuff throughout high school so there wasn't really a chance even if i wanted to. \n\nWe end up going to the same university and had a class together. I started talking to her again. She's now single and been out of her last relationship for about 2 months. We end up hanging out every weekend for a few weeks, hiking, bowling, sitting down and watching movies, whatever, it seemed to be going well. \n\nHalloween roles around and we are going to a party together. I find a good moment where we are alone to ask her if she wanted to go steady. She told me that she wasn't really looking for a relationship at the moment, (she stressed that she had definitely thought about a relationship with mw and that i wasn't in her friend zone). Im obviously upset and decide to sleep it off in my car that night. She texts me in the middle of that night saying she was really sorry and stuff like that. i ignore it and hit the hay.\n\nI stop actively pursuing her. I text less often. and started hanging with other people for a couple of weeks. All of a sudden she starts all out texting me, in the mornings to when we go to bed. It is like never before. \n\nAnd now she's giving me what i consider 'signals', by asking me how she looks, fishing for compliments, saying i look nice, complimenting my hair style and stuff like, she even described to me what kind of panties she wears, and offering me rides. She brushes my shoulder a lot and has gotten a lot more touchy feely. \n\nSo i think she trying to say something but I'm not really sure.

The house was rebuilt brand new within the past few years, and we knew we just had to have it when we saw it. The process has been relatively painless up to this point, including the resolution of several things from the home inspection process.\n\nFast forward to yesterday: law office sends over a correspondence letting us know that one of the sellers has died, but the remaining spouse still intends to move forward with the sale. Instant remorse and sorrow set in; despite hardly knowing the person. Then my wife brings up a valid point: what if the person died in the house? Will we still be comfortable to move forward ourselves, given that knowledge? I dismissed this, figuring hey the sellers are young, it probably was an accident of some sort (not trying to sound insensitive here, just trying to get my point across).\n\nI spoke to our lawyer last night, and basically was told that we are in a binding contract, and (barring a homicide or wrongful death in the house of sorts) would need to move forward so long as the seller wishes to move forward. Outside of this, we would need to involve a litigator, and that will create a huge headache I an sure.\n\nNow, we just found out that the seller did indeed die in the house (suddenly).\n\nI don't know how to feel or what to think. Maybe we're overreacting? My wife is more disturbed over the situation then I am, but I still feel unrest. Any and all advice or constructive criticism is welcome. Are we right to feel this way?

Especially if one has no real intention to work in academia even after grad school ...\nRather self-explanatory post, but just to elaborate a little further...\n\nHas anyone, after working for a period of time, decided for whatever reasons to head back into academia to pursue a PhD in Computer Sc, with no intention to join the world of academia but intend to head back into the industry? If so, what were the reasons. Also, how did it turn out? Was there anything that you regretted? Did it work out?\n\nThe reason I'm asking for advice is because currently I'm employed full-time, and know how fortunate I am to have a job in these hard times. However, being from a foreign country and working in the UK, they are making it difficult for one to extend one's working visa because I do not possess a Masters/PhD and only a Bachelor's. \n\nIt's just a little frustrating because I have been here almost half a decade now, but I have been sitting on a visa that has no count towards residency and soon, I will have to apply for a visa with even more restrictions. \n\nI'm thus considering boosting up my paper qualifications, so as to prevent myself from being in such a situation ever again. I believe the stipend from grad school actually pays almost as much as I am earning now (in terms of spending power, not direct currency conversion), but of course, given if I spent 5 years working as opposed to studying, there might be opportunities for raises/promotions.\n\nObviously, plunging into a PhD solely for that reason is bound to get looks of disapproval. I am, of course, interested in expanding my knowledge and having an opportunity to have time for myself. I have had research experience (published a paper, presented at conferences) so I'm aware of the challenges research presents.\n\nAny advice from people who have gone through similar situations?

There was this guy who had a house with a big ramp that goes to the garage (which was also the main floor of the house).We would ride a bike as fast as we could all the way down the ramp until the front tire hits a wall (not very clever I know, it was hell fun tho).  \nIt turns that we only had this old bike with a broken seat - it didn't have anything covering it up, so the three tiny irons that work as the structure were exposed.\nAfter riding the ramp a couple times I noticed that something went wrong. At that moment, I only noticed a small cut on my thigh. But I started to feeling that there was *something else* . I was afraid of finding out what actually happened and I was feeling really embarrassed to ask for help (I thought my brother's friends would make fun of me or something). So I stayed behind a small wall near the gate while they were playing on the street (I didn't have a plan, I don't know what I was doing lol). Then a neighbor sees me there, hiding and crying. She immediately tells my brother about it, I don't say what is going on so he takes me home. Once mom gets home I have to tell her. When she looks at it she got desperate and 30 min later I am at the emergency room getting 9 stitches on my scrotum. \nI got a Y-shape scar.", I was riding a bike with a broken seat all the way down a big ramp. I hit the wall and the seat cuts my sac. I got 9 stitches on it.,['•complete summary.'],1.0,1.0,0.9999999999999999,0.9999999999999999,0.40526309275405614,0.8247430278381591,0.0,0.5059277768171071,0.7252689492031388,0.0,0.31777672369291854,0.8058977205696074,0.4363362266975397,0.6466881710281793,0.5378661683766219,0.4749551920091416,0.916781996480015,0.519305831428668,0.4797626348378422,0.6891063155944774,0.47526478303081743,0.4325068930214129,0.6878545568647594
