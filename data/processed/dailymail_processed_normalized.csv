He once described himself as 'Liberal Democrat to the last'.\n\nScroll down for video \n\nVolunteer: Richard Symonds, who joined the Wikipedia project in 2004, says he was not being political\n\nMr Symonds decided to block a user called 'Contribsx' on Tuesday after concluding the account was probably operated either by Mr Shapps or under his 'clear direction'. Mr Shapps angrily denied the claims, insisting the story was 'untrue from start to finish'.\n\nMr Symonds' decision was also criticised by other Wikipedia activists, who warned that the site should not be used to 'play politics' and referred the case to an internal arbitration committee.\n\nOne user wrote: 'I don't know if 'Chase me ladies, I'm the Cavalry' did anything wrong but it's just rather obscure, and doing this during the peak campaign time for the UK 2015 elections as some sort of assignment from a journalist seems odd.'\n\nMr Symonds, from Bow, East London, described himself on Twitter as 'Liberal Democrat (to the last)' before deleting his profile yesterday.\n\nHe joined other party members who signed a letter to The Guardian in January last year calling for Lord Rennard to have the Lib-Dem whip withdrawn over his refusal to apologise for making unwanted advances to female activists.\n\nThe internet expert, who has served in the Royal Naval Reserve, has been a Wikipedia volunteer since 2004 and became an administrator for the website in 2007.\n\nHe is also a paid employee of Wikimedia UK, a charity which promotes the volunteer-written encyclopedia.\n\nFurious denials: Grant Shapps yesterday continued to deny he was behind the Wikipedia changes\n\nAmong his Facebook friends is Wikipedia co-founder Jimmy Wales, who married Tony Blair's former diary secretary Kate Garvey in 2012.\n\nHe was once featured in a BBC profile that called him 'one of the UK's top Wikipedians' and reported that he spent up to eight hours a day working on the site.\n\nResponding to the criticism yesterday, Mr Symonds insisted he was not a Lib-Dem activist and said he would never let his political views interfere with his Wikipedia work.\n\nHe added: 'I have never considered myself 'active' in any party, although I have been a lapsed member of the Lib Dems on and off, for probably a year in total since 2010.'\n\nMr Symonds toned down his conclusions about Mr Shapps' possible connections to 'Contribsx', revisions to one of his Wikipedia pages show.\n\nAt first he claimed the Tory chairman ran the account either directly or indirectly, but later he changed this to suggest simply that the account was run by a user called 'Hackneymarsh' who was linked to Mr Shapps' office by The Guardian in 2012.\n\nMr Symonds admitted that Wikipedia's top officials had 'chastised' him for his handling of the case, although he refused to back down yesterday.\n\nHe said: 'While a link has clearly been drawn between Hackneymarsh and Contribsx, it is impossible to know who was sitting behind the keyboard of Contribsx.\n\n'But given the nature of edits, I suspect that it was Mr Shapps or someone close to him.'\n\nThe Liberal Democrats used the claims to poke fun at the Tory chairman when the story broke on Tuesday night, and senior figures in the party continued mocking him yesterday.\n\nLib-Dem leader Nick Clegg said he believed the denials but then joked that the person behind the account could have been 'Michael Green', the pseudonym used by Mr Shapps to promote get-rich-quick schemes before he became an MP.\n\nA Lib-Dem spokesman said Mr Symonds had 'no connection to Lib Dem HQ'.\n\n'The first time we saw this story was in the Guardian, and the first time we know about him was when we were asked about him this afternoon,' he added.\n\nMinister Justine Greening, left, and Tory election supremo Lynton Crosby, right, were among those mentioned in the Wikipedia edits\n\nMr Shapps yesterday continued to furiously deny he was behind the Wikipedia changes, and Tory cabinet ministers rallied behind him.\n\nHe said: 'It's categorically untrue. It's absolutely nothing to do with me. It's just ridiculous. It looks like an extreme dirty tricks campaign designed to do anything but talk about policies.'\n\nDavid Cameron came to his defence, insisting the Welwyn Hatfield MP was doing a 'great job'.\n\nWikimedia UK spokesman Stevie Benton said to the best of his knowledge Mr Symonds did not brief the Liberal Democrats about his actions.\n\n'I would be incredibly surprised if he had done and would say it's out of character,' he told the Daily Telegraph.\n\n'I've worked with Richard for three and a half years and his politics have never entered into anything in that time.'\n\nThe Guardian rejected criticism that its story did not made it plain that it had prompted the Wikipedia inquiry into alleged links between 'Contribsx' and Mr Shapps.\n\nA spokeswoman for the paper said: 'The article clearly states that this was a Guardian investigation which brought to light some potential breaches of Wikipedia's own rules, which were then communicated to the site's administrators.'\n\nUnite leader Len McCluskey has become embroiled in a claim against his trade union for bullying and sexual harassment.\n\nAs part of a constructive dismissal claim under investigation by an employment tribunal, former union official Sally Nailard has accused the Unite general secretary of calling her a 'scab'. The 50-year-old former regional officer based at Heathrow is seeking undisclosed compensation.\n\nThe case lifts the lid on alleged 'discrimination, misogyny and bullying' at the hard-Left union. The chairman of the employment tribunal in Watford, Isabel Manley, described the case as a 'sad and sorry tale'. More than half of Labour candidates in its 106 target seats are linked to Unite.\n\nMr McCluskey is one of several union officials cited in Miss Nailard's claim.\n\nShe resigned from her £47,000 position last August, following an alleged 18-month campaign of bullying and harassment. Her evidence submitted to the tribunal, seen by the Independent, relates to a copy of an interview she gave to Sky News in 1997 after a cabin crew strike which she didn't take part in. Her evidence states: 'If I was such a ""scab"" as Len McCluskey later said, I would have volunteered to operate as crew over the strike.'\n\nThe tribunal continues.","Official who accused Mr Shapps of doctoring his profile a former Lib Dem..

We apologise unreservedly to those front runners.\n\n'In 33 years of running... this is the first time this has happened and as part of our debrief we will be analysing the arrangements carefully... to learn for 2016.\n\n'We understand runners have trained for a long time for the event and it's hard for them and we do empathise with how they are feeling.'\n\nIt was hoped that the event would have raised more than £70,000 for the British Heart Foundation. \n\nSome racers took to Twitter to vent their frustration over the blunder.

The discovery comes as scientists in the US made a breakthrough that could lead a test to flag up the most aggressive forms of prostate cancer.\n\nA protein has been identified which seems to play a crucial role in the rapid growth of tumours.\n\nThe breath test discovery is hoped to save thousands of lives. About 7,000 people develop stomach cancer in the UK each year and most of these cases are in the advanced stages when they are diagnosed.\n\nResearch leader Professor Hossam Haick of the Russell Berrie Nanotechnology Institute in Haifa, said: 'The attraction of this test lies in its non-invasiveness, ease of use, rapid predictiveness, insensitivity to confounding factors, and potentially low cost.'\n\nBreathe: The tscreening system spots chemical signals in exhaled air that are linked to tumour development (stock image)\n\nPrevious research has found that other methods could be used to identify stomach cancer, but none looked at detecting pre-cancerous changes.\n\nIn the study published online in the journal Gut, breath samples were taken from 484 people, including 99 already diagnosed with stomach cancer.\n\nThey were analysed by so-called nanomaterial sensors, which are able to read a chemical signal or pattern linked with stomach cancer based on very small particles in a patient's breath.\n\nThe test is so accurate it could detect the difference between early and late stage gastric cancers. The researchers hope the breath test could be used as an alternative to endoscopies, an invasive and expensive procedure to diagnose gastric cancers using a long flexible tube.\n\n A large trial involving thousands of patients, including those with stomach cancer or pre-cancerous changes, is currently under way in Europe to test the technology's suitability as a screening method, they add.\n\nMeanwhile, US experts say the discovery of a new biomarker protein may one day lead to a test which differentiates men with aggressive prostate cancer from those with a less threatening form of the disease. The findings, published in the scientific journal Oncogene, raises hope of tests that deliver an accurate diagnosis from the outset.\n\nThe results could lead to more targeted treatment for those with the worst cancers – and less treatment for men whose tumours are not dangerous. Professor Renny Franceschi, of the University of Michigan, said it paves the way for a 'warning light' that signals how dangerous the cancer is. It might also one day lead to a treatment which stops tumours growing.\n\nProstate cancer is the most common cancer among men, with 40,000 diagnosed in Britain every year. Current tests only identify whether a tumour is likely to be present.\n\nBut they are unreliable, holding a high risk of 'false positives' that wrongly identify healthy men as having cancer.\n\nProfessor Franceschi said that if further research proves positive, eventually it might lead to a test involving a simple biopsy when the patient first complains of symptoms.","Tests spot chemical signals in exhaled air linked to tumour development ..

But last week it was on the issue of quotas, or more specifically FA chairman Greg Dyke's idea of increasing the number of homegrown players in a Premier League squad of 25 from eight to 12.\n\n'I believe that we are in the world of competition,' said Wenger in one of his regular interviews to beIN Sports. 'That means as well that the rules of the game must be structured to favour the best or we are not in a competition anymore.\n\nArsenal manager Arsene Wenger shows his frustrations during a Premier League match in March 2011\n\nFA chairman Greg Dyke pictured attending the friendly between England and Italy in Turin on Tuesday\n\n'So we can say one or two things – we protect the mediocre or we produce the best players. If you want to sell the Premier League for a huge amount of money then we need to say: ""Buy this, this is the best league in the world."" You cannot go against the quality and what is at the heart of our job, which is competition.'\n\nAnd on the surface there seems nothing wrong with this. As an economics graduate Wenger is a disciple of Adam Smith and these are the basic principles of a free market. Tear down barriers, let competition flourish and the best man or woman will ultimately win – or at least have a place in Wenger's starting XI.\n\nIt sounds sensible enough but of course the issue is a little more complex than Wenger implies. A cursory glance at Wenger's transfer record shows in his bid to save the Premier League from English mediocrity he has signed Tomas Danilevicius, Igor Stepanovs, Kaba Diawara, Sebastian Squillaci, Andre Santos, Amoury Bischoff, Park Chu-Young, Marouane Chamakh, Pascal Cygan, Philippe Senderos, Denilson, Manuel Almunia and Johan Djourou.\n\nArsenal's Andre Santos on the ball during a league match against Blackburn Rovers at Ewood Park in 2011\n\nMarouane Chamakh (left) attempts to control the ball during a Capital One Cup clash with Reading in 2012\n\nArsenal midfielder Denilson (left) holds off Leyton Orient's Stephen Dawson at the Emirates in 2011\n\nThere are more but that's what a brief search elicits. You might argue that you need to sign ten Park Chu-youngs to get one Robin van Persie. And of course, over 18 years any manager, even a great one as Wenger is, can make some dud buys. He made some very good ones from abroad as well: Thierry Henry, Robert Pires, Cesc Fabegas... we could go on.\n\nBut the list of shame does expose a flaw at the heart of his argument. Clubs always argue for fewer restrictions and they always say it is to do with excellence. The reality is it's just as much to do with cost. There is nothing in Greg Dyke's proposals to stop Mesut Ozil, Alexis Sanchez and Santi Cazorla playing for Arsenal. It might however make it a little trickier for the likes of Almunia, Andre Santos and Stepanovs in the future.\n\nThe reason why Arsenal went for Stepanovs back in 2000 was not because it he was excellent; it was because he was cheaper than the equivalent English player; same with Almunia in 2004 and Andre Santos in 2011. Turns out they weren't good enough either.\n\nArsenal's Park Chu-young in action during a Carling Cup match against Shrewsbury Town in 2011\n\nIgor Stepanovs (left) battles with Sunderland's Kevin Phillips for the ball at Highbury in December 2000\n\nArsenal goalkeeper Manuel Almunia watches a shot go wide at the Emirates Stadium in January 2011\n\nNow it may be that applying more quotas could be detrimental to Dyke's vision of encouraging clubs to play English players in that it pushes their price up even more. That's a debate worth having but the main thrust of Dyke's proposals is simply to encourage the clubs to rely less on the marketplace and grow their own players.\n\nFor Wenger's argument sounds great in theory but the reality is that there is a class of players at the tip of the footballers' pyramid which stand out and which any team would want – the Thierry Henrys, Patrick Vierias of this world. Nothing in Dyke's rules to prevent them from signing, as they were EU nationals. You would only have to be a little more sure you could find space for them as one of your 13 – that's 13! – foreign players in your squad of 25.\n\nBut there is another tier of players below that – let's says the Mathieu Flamini and Mikel Arteta level (who would also still be available under they Dyke proposals as EU players). These are good players, but they are much more plentiful than the elite. In fact, given the right training and a chance in the first team, you could probably produce your own. Arsenal did once: Ray Parlour. Served Wenger quite well, too, in his double-winning and Invincible years.\n\nRay Parlour falls to the ground after a tackle by Tottenham's Jamie Redknapp at White Hart Lane in 2004\n\nWenger (left) watches on from the touchline as Arsenal face Monaco in the Champions League last month\n\nBut Parlour was developed before Wenger arrived and he was the beneficiary of a youth system which was thriving at the time. The Arsenal manager, since his arrival, has never shown an awful amount of interest in Arsenal's youth set-up. He is undoubtedly a manager who supports young players – it's just most of them are signed from abroad or Southampton rather than coming from his own academy.\n\nThe fact that Kieran Gibbs and Jack Wilshere are regular starters and were players developed at Arsenal's academy during Wenger's 18 years is exceptional for his period as manager. Ashley Cole was his greatest find from that source but who knows what would have happened to him had Silvinho not had to leave the club suddenly when his Portuguese nationality was called into question?\n\nAll Dyke is trying to do is focus clubs and their managers on trying a little bit harder to look in their own backyard before spending £2million on Pascal Cygan. Nothing he has proposed would stop Premier League clubs from signing genuine superstars. The 'best league in the world' (the league, incidentally, without any qualifiers in the Champions League quarter-finals under the current policy) is under no threat whatsoever.\n\nArsenal's Kieran Gibbs (left) breaks past QPR's Darnell Furlong at Loftus Road last month\n\nArsenal's Jack Wilshere (front) charges forward with the ball during a friendly against Brentford on Tuesday\n\nSadly Dyke probably killed his idea by announcing it in public before asking the clubs. If there is one thing guaranteed to rile the Premier League, it's attempting to dictate terms. The only way to cajole the multi-national group of owners and executives into helping English football is by convincing them it's in their own interests.\n\nMost are already on board in theory with the narrative that homegrown players are worthwhile. But now they need an additional nudge to take the final step and actually play some of their expensively-trained academy players. Even Mauricio Pochettino, who has a great track record with English players, wouldn't have given Harry Kane a go if Roberto Soldado and Emmanuel Adebayor had been producing.\n\nBut if Kane isn't a good enough incentive for the Premier League clubs to work harder to promote players, perhaps their recent travails in the Champions League and Europa League might convince them. A majority of the best players in the world are being produced in Spain and South America; another significant proportion come from Germany.\n\nTottenham's Emmanuel Adebayor gestures during the Capital One Cup semi-final in January\n\nTottenham star Harry Kane celebrates after scoring against Leicester at White Hart Lane last month\n\nThe best of those players will naturally aspire to play for Barcelona, Real Madrid and Bayern Munich. Now that Financial Fair Play restrictions mean the wages are no bigger over here, those that come to the Premier League will be the second tier of stars that can't make it at those clubs. If English clubs want to be the best in the world, they're going to have to become an awful lot better at creating the best players.\n\nAnd if Wenger wants to examine something truly mediocre he might wish to cast his eye over the Premier League's record in Europe over the past three seasons. In fact, if he paid a little more attention to building a core of homegrown players then perhaps, like Ajax, AC Milan, Manchester United, Barcelona and Bayern Munich, Arsenal might have won the Champions League by now.",Fa chairman Greg Dyke wants to increase the minimum homegrown players in a Premier League squad of 25 from eight to 12..

Be ready for a quake.'\n\nThe whales first began to appear on the beach last week but officials said they had discovered eight more bodies today.\n\nLocal residents had rushed to the beaches with buckets and towels in an attempt to help keep the marine mammals alive. \n\nScientists are still investigating what caused the whales to become stranded on the beaches of Hokota city\n\nLocal resident used buckets of water in an attempt to keep the melon-headed whales alive on the beaches\n\nOfficials have spent the weekend removing and buring the dead melon-headed whales after they stranded\n\nHowever, almost all of the animals have now died although a few were returned to the ocean.\n\nThe strandings in 2011 before the magnitude 9 earthquake off the coast of Japan is not the first association of whale strandings with tectonic activity.\n\nAround 100 pilot whales died in a mass stranding on a remote beach in New Zealand just two days before a large earthquake hit Christchurch in 2011.\n\nThe 2004 Boxing Day earthquake in the Indian Ocean that also triggered a devastating tsunami also saw 170 whales stranded on beaches in Australia and New Zealand in the days before.\n\nThose whales that survived were taken back out to sea by the Japan Coast Guard to return them to the ocean\n\nJapan Coast Guard personnel managed to return some of the whales back to the sea\n\nThe whales were stranded on two beaches close to Hokota city around 60 miles north of Tokyo\n\nAccording to the US Geological Survey, which monitors tremors around the world, there was a small magnitude 5.3 earthquake 157 miles (252km) off the coast of Namie, Japan.\n\nQuakes of this size are relatively common along the fault line.\n\nHowever, researchers have found it is possible detect tiny pulses in the Earth's magnetic field in the areas around the epicentre of earthquakes in the weeks before they occur.\n\nResearchers at San Jose State University have been developing new techniques to use these pulses to predict earthquakes using highly sensitive magnetometres.\n\nHowever, it is not know if whales have the ability to detect such tiny fluctuations.\n\nTadasu Yamada, a senior researcher at the National Museum of Nature and Science, said investigations were still ongoing into what caused the whales to strand in Hokato.\n\nHe told public broadcaster NHK: 'We don't see any immediate signs of diseases on their bodies, such as cancer.\n\n'We want to figure out what killed these animals.'\n\nResidents struggled to return the whales to the sea after the mammals became exhausted in the shallow water\n\nOnce stranded, the animals are vulnerable to dehydration and sunburn until rescuers can use the high tide to move their massive weight back into deeper water.\n\nEfforts to save the dolphins stood in marked contrast to the global view of Japan and its relationship with cetaceans.\n\nDespite international opprobrium, Japan hunts minke and pilot whales off its coast, and has for many years also pursued the mammals in the Antarctic Ocean, where it takes advantage of a scientific exemption to an international moratorium on whaling.\n\nIt has never made a secret of the fact that meat from the animals is consumed.\n\nA United Nations court ruled last year that the Antarctic hunt was a commercial venture masquerading as research, prompting Tokyo to suspend operations, but it vowed to redesign the programme to make it more scientific.\n\nThe International Whaling Commission's (IWC) panel of experts said today that it opposed Japan's proposal for its scientific research whaling programme, saying it did not demonstrate a need for killing whales.","The whales washed up along a 6 mile stretch of Coast near Hokato, Japan ..

Bates said he meant to use his stun gun but ended up firing his handgun instead.\n\n""Oh! I shot him. I'm sorry,"" Bates said in a video of the shooting.\n\nBut it's happened before. In a well-publicized 2009 case, a Bay Area Rapid Transit police officer fired his gun instead of his Taser, killing 22-year-old Oscar Grant in Oakland, California.\n\nThe former officer, Johannes Mehserle, testified that he had meant to use his Taser but drew his gun instead. Mehserle was sentenced to two years in prison for involuntary manslaughter but was released early due to good conduct.\n\nSo how easy -- or hard -- is it to draw and fire a handgun mistakenly instead of a Taser? Here are some factors to consider:\n\nLaw enforcement experts say the gun should be holstered on the officer's dominant side of the body, and the Taser should be placed on the nondominant side. So if an officer is left-handed, the gun should be on the left side.\n\nBates' attorney said his client is left-handed. But the reserve deputy said his gun was holstered on his right side -- his nondominanant side.\n\n""I shoot long guns left handed and handguns right handed,"" Bates said in a written statement to investigators.\n\nAfter Bates announced at the scene he was going to use his Taser, he ""used his nondominant hand, and it was the gun,"" said Clark Brewster, Bates' attorney.\n\n""He said that he saw the laser sight on the shoulder, assumed it was the Taser,"" Brewster said. ""Both the gun and the Taser have a laser sight, and he just made a mistake.""\n\nBrewster also said his client's left hand was holding a pepper gun.\n\nIn his statement to investigators, Bates said he had grabbed a ""pepper ball launcher"" to try to slow or stop Harris, who was running away.\n\nBates did not say explicitly where the Taser was on his body. But he admitted to grabbing the wrong device and said he was ""startled"" by the recoil of the gun.\n\n""After realizing what had happened I was in a state of shock and disbelief,"" he told investigators.\n\nBates is now charged with second-degree manslaughter. If convicted, he faces up to four years in prison.\n\nDeputy who shot Eric Harris turns himself in\n\nBates was carrying his personal gun, a Smith & Wesson .357 five-shot revolver, and a Model X26 Taser, he said in his statement to investigators.\n\nAttorneys representing the Harris family said there are stark differences between the two devices.\n\nOne held up a small black .357 revolver, followed by a mostly bright yellow Taser that was noticeably larger than the gun.\n\n""There's no way an officer can get this confused with this,"" said one of the attorneys from the law firm of Smolen, Smolen & Roytman.\n\nTaser's X26 model comes in different designs. Some are mostly yellow, while others are mostly black with a yellow panel in the middle. But all appear to be larger than Smith & Wesson .357 five-shot revolvers.\n\nSgt. Jim Clark of the Tulsa Police Department -- which is separate from the county sheriff's office for which Bates volunteered -- said Bates was the ""victim"" of something called ""slip and capture."" That's when a person intends to do one thing but instead does another in a high-stress situation.\n\nBut a criminal justice expert told CNN the claim amounts to ""junk science.""\n\n""There's no peer-reviewed articles that would support this. ... It's not generally accepted by the scientific community,"" said Phil Stinson, an assistant professor of criminal justice at Bowling Green State University. ""So it's something that in most courts would not be admissible as evidence.""\n\nAn attorney for the Harris family said the ""slip and capture"" theory hasn't held up in court.\n\n""The only time slip and capture has ever been used as a defense was in the shooting in Oakland (of Oscar Grant),"" the attorney said. And that defense failed.\n\nTasers are built to feel and look different than guns, according to Taser International.\n\nSteve Tuttle, vice president for strategic communications at Taser, noted some of those differences to CNN: A gun is heavier. A Taser has a different grip and feel. When you take the safety off on a Taser, an LED control panel lights up.\n\nThere's more: Tasers can be different colors (yellow or black), and the holster is different from a gun's.\n\nBut in the field, where an officer reacts on instinct, there are other distinctions outside of the product itself that are important, Tuttle said.\n\nTaser's training calls for the stun gun to be placed on an officer's nondominant side, as law enforcement experts say. And its training suggests that officers shout aloud, ""Taser! Taser! Taser!"" as they prepare to deploy it.\n\nThese guidelines are designed so that in the moment -- when an officer's muscle memory kicks in -- the body reflexively knows which weapon it is reaching for.\n\nIt is up to each law enforcement department, however, in how it trains personnel and what regulations it requires as far as placement on the body.\n\nThe company declined to comment on the Tulsa shooting in particular.\n\nThe stun guns, or conducted electrical weapons, manufactured by Taser have been used more than 2.7 million times, Tuttle said, and are designed to be used in situations that are not considered life or death.\n\nCNN's Catherine E. Shoichet, Brooke Baldwin, Ed Lavandera and Mariano Castillo contributed to this report.","Attorney: Robert Bates assumed the gun was a Taser because he saw a laser sight on it..

Gluten-free almond and orange torte made with half the sugar \n\nDr Briden explains that PMS has often been dismissed as a myth in the past, but that new research has indicated a link between inflammation and PMS. \n\n'PMS has been a controversial diagnosis because researchers have not been able to detect any difference in the blood levels of hormones of PMS-sufferers compared to non-PMS-sufferers,' says Dr Briden. 'In both groups, oestrogen and progesterone levels rise and fall throughout the month just like they're supposed to.\n\n'That has led some researchers to dismiss PMS as a myth, but I see it another way.\n\nHormonal: PMS is caused by your response to the drop in hormones, which depends on the health of your hormone receptors... A primary cause of unhealthy receptors is chronic inflammation\n\n'Of course PMS-sufferers have normal hormone levels. That's because female hormones are not the actual cause of PMS. Why did we ever think they would be? Neither oestrogen nor progesterone are inherently bad for mood. Quite the opposite. They're both beneficial for mood because they boost neurotransmitters such as serotonin.\n\n'I've worked with thousands of PMS patients, and I'm convinced: PMS is not caused by hormones, or even by the drop in hormones (which is inevitable at the end of the menstrual cycle). Instead, PMS is caused by your individual response to that drop in hormones.\n\nDr Lara Briden has been a naturopathic doctor specialising in women's health for 20 years\n\n'This is where it gets interesting. Your response to hormones depends on the health and resilience of your hormone receptors, which are the tiny docking stations for your female hormones, and are found in every tissue, including your brain.\n\n'Your hormone receptors translate hormonal messages into real physical effects such as mood or appetite. \n\n'When your receptors are healthy, they're flexible, and they adapt to rising and falling hormone levels by simply dialling up and dialling down their response (depending on the level of hormone). That means no PMS.\n\n'When your receptors are not healthy, on the other hand, they cannot adapt to changing hormones, and that leads to premenstrual symptoms.\n\n'Fortunately, we know what impairs the health of hormone receptors: Chronic inflammation. According to a recent study, blood markers of inflammation are higher in PMS-sufferers. Chronic inflammation is a kind of long-term immune activation that is caused by different things including stress and smoking. It's also caused by certain inflammatory foods, and that's why diet is so effective as PMS treatment.' \n\nOff the table: Deep fried and sugary foods are the most inflammatory, and therefore should be avoided\n\nEAT FEWER INFLAMMATORY FOODS  \n\nThe most inflammatory foods are deep-fried foods and high-sugar foods such as desserts and sweet drinks, so you should avoid those. You should also avoid fruit juice because it is concentrated sugar. Whole fruit is permitted.\n\nSugar and deep fried foods are inflammatory for everyone, but other foods, such as wheat and dairy products, can also be inflammatory if you have a sensitivity to them. \n\nFood sensitivities are well known to cause symptoms such as sinus or eczema, but they are also a common cause of PMS. Try avoiding wheat and dairy for three months, and see the difference. If in doubt, speak to your doctor or nutritionist.\n\nTip: PMS is a common symptom of food sensitivities.\n\nEat the rainbow: Brightly-coloured fruits and vegetables such as berries, spinach and kale provide essential nutrients such as folate and magnesium\n\nEAT MORE ANTI-INFLAMMATORY FOODS  \n\nThe foods that actively reduce inflammation are fruits and vegetables, especially the brightly coloured ones such as berries, spinach, and kale. \n\nFruit and vegetables are anti-inflammatory because they provide essential nutrients such as folate and magnesium, and because they provide phytonutrients. Phytonutrients are beneficial plant compounds that stimulate your immune system and to reduce its inflammatory response.\n\nSupplements: Dr Briden recommends mineral magnesium and vitamin B6 to supplement diet\n\nSUPPLEMENT WITH NATURAL ANTI-INFLAMMATORY NUTRIENTS  \n\nMy favourite anti-inflammatory nutritional supplement is the mineral magnesium. Together with vitamin B6, magnesium has done extremely well in clinical trials for premenstrual syndrome. Both supplements are safe and easy to obtain. Speak to your chemist.\n\nTip: The No-More-PMS Diet works to prevent PMS. Please follow it during all the days of your cycle - not just when you're premenstrual. \n\nLara Briden is a naturopathic doctor with nearly 20 years experience in women's health. She's just released her new book Period Repair Manual: Natural Treatment for Better Hormones and Better Periods.","No-more-pms Diet consists of ANTI-INFLAMMATORY FOODS and NUTRIENTS..

They said I embarrassed my country and I would be in big trouble when we are at home.'\n\nAfter three months sleeping rough, Mr Keita handed himself in to authorities and was locked up in an immigration detention centre.\n\nWhile there he made two requests for asylum, both of which were rejected. After the second failed request, he was told he had to leave Britain on December 17, 2013.\n\nHe agreed to board a plane to Ghana, but upon arrival there he said that he was turned back because he did not have the correct travel documents. He returned to Britain and was once again detained. \n\nHowever, he was released in March 2014 and has since been coaching judo in Stoke-on-Trent.

I want to be near my family and I want to see them but I can't.'\n\nHis request to stay in Britain has been backed by the African Social Health Agency, which supports asylum seekers. It described Mr Keita as an asset to the local community.\n\nA Home Office spokesman said: 'We do not routinely comment on individual cases.\n\n'The UK has a proud history of granting asylum to those who need our protection and we consider every claim on its individual merits.\n\n'When someone is found not to need our protection, we expect them to leave the country.'","Facinet Keita, 31, represented Guinea in Men's +100kg Judo but lost bout..

It is Hamilton's pole.\n\nBack on track and all 10 drivers are out for their final runs and they're all on fresh tyres. Here we go…   \n\nMeanwhile...\n\nVettel crosses the line to go fourth fastest as he splits the Williams pair of Massa and Bottas. We've got four minutes to run.   \n\nThe Mercedes pair are so much quicker than the rest of the field here. Raikkonen is the first of the Ferrari drivers to post a time and he is the best part of two seconds slower than Hamilton on a used set of option tyres.  \n\nAnd Hamilton crosses the line with a 1:35.782. Wow. What can Rosberg do? The Mercedes man is 0.280secs slower than his team-mate.\n\nBottas is the first driver to post a competitive lap, and he crosses the start-finish line with a 1:37.903… but it is Hamilton up next.    \n\nWe'll see two runs from each driver and Hamilton is the first of the Mercedes pair to take to the track.   \n\nSo, we're already underway with the final session to determine the top 10… surely, Lewis Hamilton won't be stopped in his quest for a third straight pole this year?\n\nSo, surprisingly both Toro Rossos fail to make the top-10 shootout with Verstappen and Sainz to start 13th and 14th tomorrow. \n\nHamilton remains the quickest man on the track. \n\nSo, we're in the last minute of Q2 and Massa, Ericsson, Nasr and Perez are facing the drop.\n\nVettel crosses the line to go faster than Raikkonen,  but he is half-a-second off Hamilton's mighty lap.\n\nRaikkonen goes third-fastest with a 1:37.1, but the Finn is seven tenths slower than Hamilton… what can Vettel do in the sister Ferrari?   \n\nNeither Ferrari driver are yet to post a time, so the best of the rest behind the Mercedes pair is currently the Lotus of Romain Grosjean, 1.6 seconds slower than Hamilton. That really is a stunning time from the world champion.  \n\nRosberg follows Hamilton across the line, but he is three tenths slower than his Mercedes team-mate. The Briton really appears to be a class above his Mercedes team-mate this weekend.  \n\nValtteri Bottas leads the way until Hamilton posts a 1:36.423 with his first run of the afternoon on the soft-option tyre. He then reports that his seat was getting really warm on that lap; a problem he mentioned during practice this morning.\n\nThe second session is underway in Shanghai to determine which drivers will make it through to the top-10 shootout. \n\nThat's quite a big shock to see McLaren on the penultimate row again. Button, Alonso and the team have been speaking with plenty of optimism this weekend, but they will start tomorrow's race only 17th and 18th.\n\nSo, the McLaren drivers do not make it out of Q1 and Button and Alonso will start on the penultimate row for tomorrow's Chinese Grand Prix. \n\nBut as I write that, Vettel goes fastest with a 1:37.502. Carlos Sainz, Pastor Maldonado, Romain Grosjean, Will Stevens and Roberto Merhi occupy the drop zone with a minute to go…   \n\nRaikkonen is back on track, on the softs, and it is the Finn's turn to top the timesheets as he goes some two tenths faster than Bottas.   \n\nValtteri Bottas and Felipe Massa are both on the option tyres for their first timed runs of the afternoon. Bottas goes fastest with a 1:38.014 as Massa slots into third.  \n\nButton, also on the soft compound, is faster than Alonso by four tenths, and he slots his McLaren into P7. The Briton comes over the radio to complain that the 'rears are overheating'.\n\nAlonso is already donning the soft compound tyre. He comes across plenty of traffic on his fast lap, but still manages to go eighth… for now.\n\nSo, with 10 minutes to go, Hamilton leads the way from Rosberg, Hulkenberg, Felipe Nasr, Vettel, Raikkonen and the ever-impressive Max Verstappen.\n\nRosberg is the next driver to cross the line and he posts a lap of 1:38.496 which is some two tenths off his team-mate. Nico Hulkenberg, on the much faster softer compound tyre, pops his Force India into third.\n\nHere comes Hamilton, who looks at ease in his Mercedes, and the British driver is 1.6 seconds faster than Vettel. Ouch.\n\nRaikkonen crosses the line to post a 1:40.917, but he appeared to be struggling with plenty of understeer on that lap and Vettel crosses the line to go one second quicker than his Ferrari team-mate.\n\nPlenty of smoke as Lewis Hamilton's Mercedes is fired up, but there's no problem with the world champion's Silver Arrows as he takes to the circuit for Q1. Kimi Raikkonen meanwhile is the first big gun out on a hot lap…\n\nFernando Alonso failed to post a time in this morning's practice session, but the Spaniard is first out of the blocks as today's qualifying session gets underway. \n\nSecurity has been ramped up for this week's race in China after a spectator managed to get on to the track during yesterday's second practice session.\n\nThe local man darted across the start-finish line before leaping over the pit wall and walking into the Ferrari garage. He is then alleged to have said: 'I want a car. I've got a ticket.'\n\nRosberg has been challenged by Mercedes F1 chairman Niki Lauda to raise his game this weekend after being outclassed by Hamilton in both races so far this term.\n\nHere, the German is taking part in his traditional warm-up before hopping into his Mercedes for this afternoon's qualifying session.\n\n \n\nThat said, Mercedes, and Lewis Hamilton in particular, appear to be back to their ominous best in Shanghai.\n\nHamilton has been fastest in all three practice sessions this weekend at a track where he has already won on three occasions and was the pole-sitter here in 2013 and again last year.\n\nThe 30-year-old posted a time of one minute 37.615secs, finishing 0.226secs quicker than team-mate Rosberg.\n\nFresh from his win in Sepang, Vettel was the best of the rest, albeit some seven tenths down on Hamilton's best lap.\n\nGood morning and welcome to our coverage of today's qualifying session for the Chinese Grand Prix.\n\nAfter Lewis Hamilton led Nico Rosberg home in a Mercedes one-two at the curtain raiser in Melbourne, we were told a year of domination from the Silver Arrows loomed. But how wrong they  were.\n\nSebastian Vettel, in his Ferrari, upset the odds to roar to victory in Malaysia to blow the race for the championship back open and give Mercedes food-for-thought ahead of this week's Chinese Grand Prix and for the remainder of the campaign.","Lewis Hamilton claimed his third straight pole position of the season ..

I think Mooresey had only just found out himself. You see it when football clubs get taken over; you tend to see different people brought in for key positions. Paul was a lovely guy and I feel sorry he's lost his job but when you get new people in, changes always happen.\n\nThere have been a few names bandied around and I think Straussy [Andrew Strauss] was considered last time the role came up a year ago, but he didn't particularly fancy it. He's certainly a very good man, but it's hard to know who would be a good candidate until we know more about what the job role is.

That can be quite a scary thing but you only get better as a group when you do that. I did an Adidas event with Harlequins winger Ugo Monye and he was saying how player-led they were at the club. During the World Cup we didn't talk enough as players and the guys weren't speaking up as much as they needed to. We needed more edge and hopefully bringing guys like Cooky and Trotty [Jonathan Trott] back into the group will help that.\n\nBroad has backed Alastair Cook to score big runs during the series in the Caribbean\n\nCaptain Cook scored a century during a warm-up game against St Kitts & Nevis\n\nRICHIE BENAUD\n\nI used to watch videos of my dad playing in the 1986-87 Ashes series and I'll always remember Richie's commentary on that. He had this way of sounding as if he was reciting commentary when he was commentating and making it relaxing and peaceful to listen to. I don't think there'll be anyone in the cricket world who won't be touched by his passing. His voice symbolised cricket and we'll all miss him.\n\nJIMMY ANDERSON\n\nHe's one of my best mates and we've played a lot of cricket together. He's taught me a huge amount and guided me through my international career. I think we're third behind Waqar [Younis] and Wasim [Akram] and Curtly [Ambrose] and Courtney [Walsh] as a pairing and that comes from us complementing each other's styles and constant communication. It would a phenomenal achievement for him to become England's leading wicket taker.\n\nBroad says that he and Jimmy Anderson are best mates and admits he has guided him through his career\n\nBroad says it will be a great achievement for Jimmy Anderson to become England's leading wicket taker\n\nFITNESS\n\nTwisting my ankle in the warm-up game was a bit of a scare, but it feels fine now.

It's still bit stiff in the morning but fingers crossed it will be OK.\n\nANTIGUA TRACK\n\nThey're generally pretty flat out here now and I think fans can expect some fairly attritional cricket for the first few days before things speed up a bit.

And it is one that is not set to change regardless of how persistent the rumours of a possible switch to Manchester United become.\n\nBale is injured and out of Wednesday's Euroderby II showdown with Atletico Madrid. Carlo Ancelotti has already gone on record as to just how important he believes the Welshman is to Real Madrid. \n\nGareth Bale is adamant that he wants to stay at Real Madrid despite strong interest from Manchester United\n\nBale has scored 17 goals for Real this season but has still bee criticised by supporters\n\nBale holds off the challenge of Atletico forward Raul Garcia during Champions League quarter-final\n\nHe said last week: 'He had a fantastic season last year and he is having a very good season this time. He did very well for us in the finals that we played and we need him for this season's run-in too.'\n\nReal Madrid's £86million player is hoping to be back in time for the Champions League semi-finals should the holders qualify. \n\nHis future continues to be the source of much speculation with Manchester United desperate to make a signing that would send shockwaves throughout world football and immediately install them as favourites to win the Premier League next season.\n\nReal Madrid have also privately declared their interest in making David de Gea the long-term successor to Iker Casillas, just as he is expected to be in the Spain side.\n\nBale is out of Real's Champions League quarter-final second leg against Atletico on Wednesday\n\nThe Wales international injured his calf during Saturday's 3-1 win against Malaga after just two minutes\n\nThe possibility of a Bale-plus-cash move for De Gea this summer would certainly suit United and please those Real Madrid supporters who fail to see the value of Bale and those goals that won the club three trophies last year, but the player remains adamant that his future is in Madrid.\n\nIn nearly all transfer wrangles the player gets what he wants over and above the desires of the clubs involved and it seems highly unlikely that he will be wearing anything other than a white shirt next season such is his desire to ride out the storm in Madrid.\n\nHe had a sensational first season in Spain winning four trophies and scoring in the Copa del Rey, Champions League and World Club Cup finals. This season he has been the target of some post-decima criticism and even booed at times in his own stadium but he is determined to win over fans who have jeered some of the greatest players in history in their time.\n\nBale enjoyed a standout first season in Madrid and won the Champions League and the Copa del Rey\n\nThe former Tottenham star scored a decisive goal in extra-time during the Champions League final last season\n\nHe wants to emulate Cristiano Ronaldo, who also had to change the minds of the disgruntled masses, and to eventually follow in his Ballon d'Or footsteps.\n\nAt the moment Ronaldo and Lionel Messi are a considerable cut above everything else in football but Bale sees himself up against Barcelona's Neymar as the young pretenders trying to dethrone football's greatest.\n\nIn the Spanish capital, while no one expects him to leave this summer, nobody sees Bale's desire to stay put as something that would necessarily prevent De Gea from arriving at the Santiago Bernabeu at the end of the season to become his team-mate.\n\nCarlo Ancelotti said recently that if the club acquired a better goalkeeper than Casillas then the Spain international would lose his place and De Gea is the man most supporters and the club directors identify as the one keeper who would justify the coach leaving out the legend. \n\nReal Madrid would like to sign Manchester United goalkeeper to be long-term successor to Iker Casillas\n\nDe Gea punches clear under a challenge from John Terry during Saturday's defeat by Chelsea\n\nDe Gea's girlfriend continues to live in Madrid and her recent unflattering comments about Manchester did little to quell rumours that family pressures are being applied on the keeper to return to Spain.\n\nHe appears no closer to signing a new contract and last year Louis van Gaal made sure he installed Victor Valdes - a keeper he knows from his Barcelona days - as De Gea's No 2.\n\nValdes was given his debut by the Dutchman and stories coming out of Old Trafford suggest that for all his heroic shot stopping, Van Gaal does not see De Gea as in anyway irreplaceable.\n\nDe Gea spent one season in the Atletico first team before joining United in 2011 for £18million\n\nAll that points to the possibility of a return to Madrid where he previously represented Atletico but left after only one season in the first team. Despite his Atletico past he has none of the emotional pull that Fernando Torres once had leading him to declare he would never play for Real.\n\nThe supporters would welcome him. Currently if they had to choose between De Gea and Bale they would opt for the goalkeeper providing there was a considerable cash bonus for sending Bale back to Britain. But they don't believe it will be necessary. They see both men lining-up for them next season.\n\nBale's desire to stay in Spain will keep him at Madrid. It only remains to be seen just how much De Gea wants to join him in the Spanish capital.",Gareth Bale has been linked with a summer move to Manchester United..

From inside the massive complex, airmen were poised to send warnings that could trigger the launch of nuclear missiles.\n\nBut in 2006, officials decided to move the headquarters of NORAD and US Northern Command from Cheyenne to Petersen Air Force base in Colorado Springs. The Cheyenne bunker was designated as an alternative command center if needed.\n\nAlmost 10 years ago, the military closed the secretive defense complex carved into Cheyenne Mountain that for decades monitored American skies for threats.\n\nThe North American Aerospace Defense Command operations center was moved to nearby Peterson Air Force Base, which is home to the U.S. Northern Command created after the Sept. 11 attacks.\n\nCheyenne Mountain Complex is 2,000 feet below the granite rocks and made up of 15 three-story buildings protected from nuclear blasts and seismic movement by a system of 1,000 giant springs.\n\nThe entire complex is designed to withstand a direct hit by a 30 megaton nuclear explosion and has 25-ton blast doors surrounding the complex.\n\nNORAD, a joint U.S. and Canadian command, was set up in the 1960s to monitor the skies for threats like missiles, aircraft and space objects.\n\nIn 2006, Adm.

This image shows 'ribbons' of sand and patterned stripes in an area known as the Erg Chech, a desolate sand sea in southwestern Algeria - but the exact cause of these longitudinal structures is not known\n\nThe image was spotted by io9 and the colours were caused as rays of sunlight hit the sand and were reflected off. \n\nLinear dunes are straight ridges of sand that have been known to measure as long as 99 miles (160km). \n\nRidges are categorised as linear when they are significantly longer than they are wide, and they occur on isolated ridges of dunes as well as, more commonly, as sets of parallel ridges separated by miles of sand and gravel. \n\nLinear dunes are straight ridges of sand that have been known to measure as long as 99 miles (160km). \n\nRidges are categorised as linear when they are significantly longer than they are wide, and they occur on isolated ridges of dunes as well as, more commonly, as sets of parallel ridges separated by miles of sand, gravel. \n\nThe dunes have also been known to merge and form so-called 'Y-shaped compound dunes', and the formation of these patterns are caused by the wind and movement of sand. \n\nBut exactly how this wind movement forms the structures is disputed.   \n\nThe dunes have also been known to merge and form so-called 'Y-shaped compound dunes', and the formation of these patterns are caused by the wind and movement of sand. \n\nBut exactly how this wind movement forms the structures is disputed.  \n\nOne theory, suggested by Steven Hanna in 1969 in his Formation of Longitudinal Sand Dunes by Large Helical Eddies in the Atmosphere paper, is that linear dunes are created by helical roll vortices.  \n\nThese are long rolls of air that spiral, or rotate one way before rotating another. \n\nThey are commonly seen in clouds, creating what's known as 'cloud streets' that appear as cumulus-type clouds.\n\nAs the wind moves and switches direction it causes the sand to move accordingly and create grooves and ridges in the sand.  \n\n'The dunes are aligned in the direction of the prevailing wind and are spaced 1.2 miles (2km apart)', explained Professor Hanna. \n\n'Observations in the atmosphere and in the laboratory indicate that dominant forms of motion in the boundary layer of the atmosphere are counter-rotating helical roll vortices aligned along the wind. \n\n'The necessary conditions for the formation of these roll vortices are fulfilled over large deserts and their spacings agree with the observed spacings of the dunes.'\n\nOne theory, suggested by Steven Hanna in 1969, is that the linear dunes are created by helical roll vortices (illustrated left). These are long rolls of air that spiral, or rotate one way before rotating another. They are commonly seen in clouds, creating what's known as 'cloud streets' that appear as cumulus-type clouds align to be parallel to the wind (illustrated right)\n\nIn his book, Geomorphology of Desert Dunes, Nicholas Lancaster from the Desert Research Institute argues that this theory has its flaws. \n\nHe said Professor Hanna compared data on the spacing of linear dunes with the expected dimensions of helical roll vortices in subtropical desert areas, concluding their 'probable wavelength was 1.9 miles to 3.7 miles (2km to 6km).'\n\nBut measured dimensions of roll vortices indicate their wavelength ranges between less than 50 metres and 31 miles (15 km).\n\n'The observed scale of helical roll vortices is in many cases much larger than average dune spacing, suggesting that linear dunes are not the product of such atmospheric motions,' explained Mr Lancaster. \n\n'Evidence for the existence of helical roll vortices in linear dune landscapes is slight. The theory is attractive but there is little empirical data to support it in dune area.'\n\nRidges are categorised as linear when they are significantly longer than they are wide, and they occur on isolated ridges of dunes as well as sets of parallel ridges separated by miles of sand and gravel. Linear dunes in the Namib Naukluft National Park, Namibia are shown. The dunes have also been known to merge and form so-called 'Y-shaped compound dunes', and patterns are caused by the wind and movement of sand\n\nAnother theory believes Barchan evolution may play a role. 'Barchans' are crescent-shaped sand dunes (top left) that form in regions where there is almost unidirectional wind. If windblown sand comes from one direction, a dune will be a crescent-shaped barchan but if winds switch direction seasonally they become linear (pictured left centre and in Morocco right)\n\nWhile in the 'Formation of the complex linear dunes in the central Taklimakan sand sea, China' study, Chinese researcher Xunming Wang and his colleagues said that in the case of 'complex' linear dunes - that are a combination of two shapes - the theory of Barchan evolution may play a role. \n\n'Barchans' are crescent-shaped sand dunes that form in regions where there is almost unidirectional wind.\n\nThe shapes depend on the wind's direction, and if windblown sand comes from one direction, for example, a dune will be a crescent-shaped barchan but if winds switch direction seasonally - coming from the southwest for half the year and from the southeast for the other half, for instance - this dune will be linear. \n\nIf wind direction is more varied, star-shaped dunes appear.\n\nThe Erg Chech features both compound and complex linear, as well as star dunes. Erg' comes from the Arabic word for 'field of sand dunes'\n\nMr Wang said: 'Complex linear dune formation is shown to have five stages. \n\n'Analysis clearly shows that under the control of wind regime, sand supply and other factors, the simple linear dunes move sideways while they evolve. \n\n' The evolutionary processes of complex linear dunes in the region partly support the theory of 'barchan evolution' but do not support the 'roll-vortex' and 'bimodal wind regime' hypotheses.'\n\nThe researchers continued that after the complex linear dunes develop,  local wind patterns and the amount of sand suggest it is possible for them to maintain their linear shape, rather than evolving into star shapes for example, even as wind direction changes. \n\nThe Erg Chech features both compound and complex linear, as well as star dunes.","The image of the patterned stripes in the Saharan Desert was captured by the Nasa's Landsat 7 satellite.. They are examples of linear, or Longitudinal, Dunes in Erg Chech - a desolate Sand sea in southwestern Algeria.. 'erg' comes from the Arabic word for 'field of Sand Dunes' and the cause of such shapes is not known.. Theories include Helical roll vortices - rolls of rotating and spiralling air - and seasonal changes in wind direction.","['\\nImportant points (directly affect coverage and overall rafing):\\nNasa’s Landsat 7 satellite captured longitudinal rainbow dunes over Saharan desert, longitudinal shape cause-theories of wind-but not known']",0.6971710851131677,1.0,0.6443386405624972,0.22604549385989947,0.5221976773677645,0.5492142440444193,0.35806468927764146,0.6702995385442025,0.6504196547167594,0.0,0.5791854650473119,0.14629873818142852,0.45188182782926845,0.30534096244141473,0.2751761256280063,0.23169773110710892,0.9174848765634863,0.2645587770127716,0.23120168329853838,0.5605168839506103,0.2175936798090145,0.19068105281579667,0.46143642766213966

He was barely heard of then. How right Thorpe was, for what Root has done since Sydney speaks volumes about the character of the bloke.\n\nDo not be fooled by the boyish grin and cheeky demeanour. He is as steely as they come, a fierce competitor who loves playing for England. He tells himself every day that he must enjoy the game but that takes nothing away from the quality of his magnificent performances.\n\nHis last five hundreds have been in excess of 149, four of them have been unbeaten and in the way he batted with Jimmy Anderson yesterday he showed he has a very good cricket brain. \n\nAnd he hasn't messed with his form either. It would be easy in his current run to chip up a catch on 40 or give it away as soon as he reaches a hundred, as Marlon Samuels did in the first innings here. I love the way Root goes big.\n\nBefore his partner was foolishly run out, Root showed maturity to bat with the tail on Friday in Grenada\n\nThe young batsman has been superb in his middle-order role, and should not be moved up the batting card\n\nPart of me sees Root as a natural No 3, where England tried him in Australia. He looks like a batsman who could come in and regain the initiative if you lose an early wicket.\n\nBut why move him when he is going so well at five? Keep him there. Eventually he will captain England and five is a good place to captain from.\n\nThe only problem in seeing him as a future England captain is that do we want to put our best player in charge when his runs are so important?\n\nLook at Alastair Cook and just about every England captain in history. It wears them all down in the end and when the day eventually comes that England need a new leader they will have to think about that.\n\nHis fabulous form should be enough to see Root left to do what he does best - score runs for England\n\nAlastair Cook (right) has shown the danger of making your best player the captain of the team\n\nI have enjoyed the battle between Ben Stokes and Samuels in this Test and I like the way the Durham lad goes about his cricket. The fact he gave Mitchell Johnson a send-off when he got him out in Australia speaks volumes for him and he'll never take a backward step.\n\nI generally don't like send-offs. Once a batsman is out you have done your job so why point to the dressing room or swear at someone? But I enjoyed what Samuels did on the third evening. If you are going to do it, make it humorous and non-threatening like that salute. Stokes will have to take it. If you dish it out you have to take it back.\n\nStokes shouldn't go too far, though. I saw Peter Moores take him to one side for a chat before play yesterday and that might have been to say: 'Be careful. Don't lose your passion but don't do anything stupid.'","Joe Root has been terrific to bounce back from a difficult time in Australia..

It had been the same way for years - although I would drink more water at weekends.'\n\nLast year, this habit caught up with him. He noticed a vague ache in his abdomen, stretching around to his back.\n\n'It wasn't agonising but it just didn't feel quite right, so I went to the GP,' he says. 'As I had some bloating, he sent me for an ultrasound.'\n\nThis revealed two large stones in his right kidney - a direct result, his doctors believe, of his low fluid intake. A CT scan showed that the stones were so large (6 mm across) they could not be passed naturally, and he needed surgery.\n\nOne in ten of us will develop a kidney stone, and the numbers are rising dramatically. They are the result of waste products in the blood forming crystals inside the kidneys, which eventually build up into a solid lump. They can be excruciatingly painful - on a level, say experts, with childbirth.\n\nThe stones often remain symptomless while they're in the kidney. They start causing pain - known as renal colic - once they travel down the ureter, the narrow tube that carries urine from the kidney to the bladder.\n\n'Renal colic is caused by the stone suddenly blocking the ureter,' says Mr Leye Ajayi, consultant urological surgeon at the Hospital of St John & St Elizabeth, London. The pain often comes on suddenly and can cause the patient to 'writhe around in agony', he adds. The pain can be intense enough to cause nausea and vomiting.\n\nOnce on the move, a stone can take days or weeks to travel out of the body. In that time, it may cause persistent or intermittent pain in the back, groin or side, a need to urinate more than usual, and pain when urinating.\n\nSometimes, if a stone blocks the exit of urine from the kidney, it can lead to a build-up of bacteria and trigger a kidney infection. Signs of this include a fever, shivering, extreme weakness, diarrhoea, or cloudy and bad-smelling urine.\n\nThe bad news is that the number of people developing troublesome stones is rocketing. Emergency admissions to hospital for kidney stones have shot up during the past decade by 136 per cent, according to official figures, rising from just above 5,000 to almost 12,000 per year.\n\nMeanwhile, the number of people going in for planned non-emergency treatment for stones has almost doubled in the same period, rising from 26,666 in 2004 to 51,340. \n\nThe cause for his condition, doctors believe, was low fluid intake\n\nAnd bizarrely, it may be that healthier lifestyles - doing tough workouts at the gym, and then not drinking enough, or shunning carbohydrates - are partly to blame, and may be why cases are going up, especially among women.\n\n'More men than women used to suffer from kidney stones, with a ratio of about three to one,' says Mr Ajayi. 'But an increasing number of women now get them, and the ratio is evening up.'\n\nThe main cause of kidney stones is dehydration. 'Your kidneys are your waste-disposal system,' explains Dr Kathryn Griffith, the Royal College of GPs' clinical champion for kidney care.\n\n'They discard all the waste chemicals produced by your body, and they can do this efficiently if enough liquid is drunk to help flush them through.\n\n'But if you become dehydrated, you overload the kidneys with urine that has a high concentration of stone-forming chemicals, and these begin to bind together to build stones.'\n\nTo avoid this, you need to drink enough to ensure your urine is 'the colour of white wine', says Dr Griffith - around 1.2 litres a day. You need more during hot weather or after exercise.\n\nChanging diet trends are also pushing the figures up.\n\n'There has been a trend, especially in people either wanting to lose weight or bulk up muscle, to eat low-carb, high-protein diets,' says Dr Griffith.\n\n'The animal proteins found in meat and fish break down into a waste chemical called uric acid (a known stone-former) in your urine. They also reduce the amount of citrate (a stone-inhibitor).\n\n'This can lead to uric acid stones forming, especially if you also don't drink enough fluid to assist the kidneys in their disposal job.'\n\nThere are other causes, too. Your kidneys remove sodium, which is the main component of salt, from your body. When they do this, they excrete calcium, too.\n\nBut low-carb diets could also put you at risk\n\nSo the more salt you eat, the more calcium you will have in your urine, which can build into stones.\n\nObesity is another risk factor. 'Obese people are more likely to have insulin resistance (where the body can't use insulin effectively),' says Mr Ajayi.\n\nThis causes a change to the nature of urine, making it more acidic, which increases the risk of uric acid stones forming in the kidney.\n\nEating excessive amounts of oxalate is another culprit, as it can lead to the formation of calcium oxalate stones - the most common kind.\n\nOxalate-rich foods include tea, spinach, rhubarb, nuts, strawberries, beetroot and chocolate. They are all fine in moderation, but avoid large daily quantities.\n\nIf you have more than two urinary tract infections within a short space of time, you should ask your GP for an ultrasound to rule out a less common kind of kidney stone called struvite stones, which are caused by a build-up of bacteria from repeated urinary tract infections, adds Dr Griffith.\n\nVirtually all stones under 5 mm in diameter can be passed naturally, with only prescription-strength pain relief and medication that relaxes the ureter needed while this happens, says Mr Ajayi.\n\nBut if a stone is bigger, you may need to have treatment. The most common is extracorporeal shock-wave lithotripsy (ESWL). This involves sending shock-waves of energy through the skin that break down the stone.\n\n'This works for stones up to about 10 mm in diameter, but not for bigger ones, or for stones that are very hard,' says Mr Ajayi. 'It's also ineffective in most cases for people with obesity, as the shock-waves have further to go to reach the stone.'\n\nFor bigger or harder stones, a ureteroscopy is performed. Under general anaesthetic, a thin scope is passed up your urethra and a laser is used to break up the stone.\n\nFor very large stones (those over 15 mm), percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) is used. A nephroscope - a telescope-like device - is inserted through a small incision in your back. The stone is broken up using a combination of high-frequency ultrasound and pneumatic energy (a bit like a pneumatic drill digging up a road).\n\nDavid Crossley had a ureteroscopy at the BMI Priory Hospital, Birmingham, in September.\n\n'I was out the day after my surgery, and although there was some discomfort around my kidneys for a few days, thankfully I'm now stone-free.'\n\nHe knows that a person who has had a stone has a 50 per cent chance of developing them again within five years unless they make changes to their lifestyle.\n\n'The lifestyle changes that can be made to stop stones recurring are the same as those for avoiding them in the first place: proper hydration, low-salt, staying a healthy weight and reducing animal protein,' says Mr Ajayi.\n\nThe British Association of Urological Surgeons advises that we should be aiming for no more than four of the following protein portions a day, two of which should be dairy to ensure you have enough calcium: 50-75 g of red meat, chicken or fish; two eggs; ½ pint of milk; 50g cheese; a small pot of yogurt.\n\nMr Ajayi also recommends drinking water with lemon juice in it daily, as the citrate (a form of acetic acid) in lemons is a natural stone inhibitor that can prevent calcium from binding with other substances, such as oxalates, that lead to stones.\n\nToday, David ensures that he gets enough fluid. 'I didn't know that being too busy to drink enough could lead to kidney stones,' he says. 'I now drink water religiously!'","Doctors believe low fluid intake led to David Crossley's kidney stones.. Ultrasound and CT scan revealed two very large stones in his right kidney.. One in ten of us will develop a kidney stone, and the numbers are rising.. Changing diet trends such as low-carb are also pushing sufferer figures up..

When it was measured it was reading UTC time to within a quarter of a second.\n\nThe National Maritime Museum confirmed the record on Twitter yesterday.\n\nIt wrote: 'Our 100 day trail of ""Clock B"" won @GWR for ""most accurate mechanical clock with a pendulum swinging in free air""!'\n\nRory McEvoy, the Observatory's curator of horology, added: 'What we've seen here is something approaching a perfect clock, but we are not there yet.'\n\nHarrison died in 1776.

Although latitude was relatively easy to determine using the sun, longitude was harder.\n\nThe problem was considered so important Parliament offered financial rewards of up to £20,000 to anyone who solved it.\n\nClockmakers argued that a heavy pendulum bob and short swing would be the best. But Harrison dismissed this theory and thought a clock with a lighter pendulum bob and wide swing would work better. He designed his first clock in 1713 aged 20.\n\nHis 'longitude' clock, which was the basis of the Martin Burgess Clock B, would solve the problem of determining longitude at sea, he claimed.\n\nBy knowing the amount of time the ship had been at sea and the local time by using the sun, sailors would be able to determine longitude accurately. Local time is one hour ahead for every 15 degrees of longitude east and one hour behind for every 15 degrees of longitude west. \n\nHe was not taken seriously by any of his contemporaries and the possibilities of his clock were not explored until the 20th century.\n\nHarrison died in 1776.

During the online chats, 'Amy' said: 'Sorry, you're too old for me.' The prosecutor said Adeli replied: 'I know, but we can be friends and talk.'\n\nMr Murphy added: 'The conversation became sexual, with the defendant leading the way.

Woody Allen was one of the very few celebrities give a complimentary seat and other famous names had to work their way into the 20,000 crowd at the Garden.\n\nFrank Sinatra persuaded Life magazine to give him a camera and send him as their ringside photographer. \n\nFast-talking Ali offensively labelled Frazier an 'Uncle Tom' due to the support he got from white conservatives \n\nReferee Tony Perez, widely believed to have acted leniently in Ali's favour, orders the pair to their corners\n\nJACK JOHNSON v JAMES JEFFRIES\n\nJuly 4, 1910, Reno, Nevada\n\nJOE LOUIS v MAX SCHMELING\n\nJune 22, 1938, Yankee Stadium, New York \n\nAuthor Norman Mailer reported on the fight.\n\nActor Burt Lancaster picked up a TV microphone for his only stint as a colour commentator.\n\nArtist Leroy Neiman sat at his easel painting Ali and Frazier as they fought.\n\nThis was one fight in which the action fully lived up to the hype and its place in history.\n\nAli came out fast to dominate the first three rounds. Frazier, encouraged by catching Ali with the last punch of the third, launched an attack to the body in the fourth which brought him into the ascendancy. \n\nAli's speed of hand, dancing feet and combination punching kept him in a fight in which he was taking increasing punishment – along with a little help from referee Arthur Mercante who declined to call a knock down when Frazier sent him crashing in the eighth. \n\nAli is laid out on the canvas as Frazier is send to the corner before a long 10-count in the 15th round \n\nSomehow, heroically, survived the especially torrid 11th and 14th rounds.\n\nStill some good judges had it close going into the 15th and last round.

public 360 kilometres  north of Brisbane in Vera Scarth-Johnson Wildflower Reserve, and it is thought that the site is a common dumping ground for unwanted racing greyhounds.\n\nScroll down for video  \n\nAn elderly couple have been charged as investigations deepen into the discovery of a mass dog grave containing the carcasses of 55 greyhounds\n\nThe shocking grisly photos show the decomposed bodies and burnt out skeletons of the greyhounds. \n\nTheir carcasses lie in thick bush grass and some are still covered in dark brown fur with gun shot wounds clearly visible. \n\nThere have been reports that the remains of the animals are scattered over an area of 200m around the reserve and no efforts have been made to conceal them.  \n\nThe 64-year-old woman is known in the local area as a greyhound trainer and when police issued her with a search warrant she put up a fight, claiming she had no idea what they were talking about. \n\nPolice found a .22 calibre gun, ammunition and a baseball bat in the woman's home. \n\nThe couple, both from Bundaberg, will appear in the Bundaberg Magistrates Court on Friday.\n\nA Queensland Police and RSPCA taskforce, set up after the greyhound racing industry was rocked by the live baiting scandal in February, found ammunition shells from a .22 calibre gun at the bush site in nearby Coonarr.\n\nThe 71-year-old man and 64-year-old woman were charged with unlawfully possessing a firearm after a police search found a rifle and ammunition in a home in Bundaberg on Thursday\n\nLocal speculation suggests the site is a common dumping ground for `wasted' dogs used by people in the industry.\n\nPolice haven't been able to confirm reports that microchips were also discovered. \n\nThe shocking scene was, in the words of Detective Superintendent Mark Ainsworth, 'nothing short of abhorrent'.\n\nPost-mortem examinations will reveal the cause of death but Ainsworth said: 'I will say that a number of spent .22 cartridge shells were found in the vicinity as well.' \n\nAnd it's unlikely to be the last horrific sight he and his colleagues are met with.\n\n'We've not even tipped the iceberg yet,' he said on Thursday morning.\n\nThe carcasses were in various states of decomposition when found by a member of the public 360 kilometres north of Brisbane in Vera Scarth-Johnson Wildflower Reserve, and it is thought that the site is a common dumping ground for unwanted racing greyhounds\n\n'It could be somebody within the industry that knows the remoteness of that area up there and knows that it's a safe place to dispose of greyhounds that can't perform within the greyhound industry,' he said before the couple were arrested. \n\nSpeaking to 9News, local resident Lloyd Blake said: 'We're quite disgusted that the dogs were dumped in our area and we hope at the end of the day that the severe fire that we had here in November is not related to the burning of the dogs.'\n\nFires ripped through the area in February and police are now investigating whether the fires were deliberately lit and linked to the burning of the greyhound carcasses. \n\nIt's also believed the animals were killed prior to the ABC's live baiting expose, judging by the level of decomposition.\n\nRacing Queensland's own probe into the use of live piglets, possums, rabbits and other small animals to train race dogs has resulted in more than 30 trainers being banned or stood down pending an internal review.\n\nThe 64-year-old woman is known in the local area as a greyhound trainer and when police issued her with a search warrant she put up a fight, claiming she had no idea what they were talking about\n\nThe shocking scene was, in the words of Detective Superintendent Mark Ainsworth, 'nothing short of abhorrent'\n\nIt's not yet known if any of those banned or suspended are those operating around Bundaberg that have been identified by police.\n\nBut Queensland Greyhound Breeders, Owners and Trainers Association president Tony Zammit maintains the wider industry has been tarnished by the action of a few 'villains and rogues'.\n\nWhile horrified to learn of the mass killing, he said comments it foreshadowed even more revelations of animal mistreatment were premature.\n\n'To me, it's an exaggerated statement,' he said.\n\n'We haven't heard the full story yet.'\n\nSpeaking at a press conference Police Minister Jo-Ann Miller was furious and appalled at the 'mass murder'.\n\n'The people who have perpetrated this crime to me are oxygen thieves , they are cowards and they are pathetic,' she said. \n\nBundaberg Greyhound Club president Stephen Bland took to Facebook to express shock at the discovery.\n\nPost-mortem examinations will reveal the cause of death but Ainsworth said: 'I will say that a number of spent .22

But the move received a backlash, with victims branding it as 'a joke'\n\nThe police internet posting showed scenes of Lego criminals attempting to break into people's homes before being arrested by officers – and were accompanied by a Scots dialect poem giving advice.\n\nBut the publicity stunt was met with criticism from politicians and victims who said officers should concentrate on solving real crimes.\n\nBreak-ins in Edinburgh rose by 38.7 per cent in the 12 months to April 2014, with 4,101 homes hit. Across Scotland, housebreakings rose 4 per cent to 22,272 over the same period.\n\nThe row will fuel concerns over the number of officers spending their days in police stations, rather than pounding the beat.\n\nLast year, critics claimed many officers were having to 'backfill' – being taken off beat duties to carry out office jobs previously covered by civilian workers.\n\nBe vigilant: The Lego figures are arranged into scenes with robbers and police officers to provide safety tips and highlight the importance of securing people's homes. Last night Police Scotland defended the campaign\n\nLast night, Police Scotland defended the campaign, pointing out that the photos have been viewed almost 350,000 times.\n\nBut Scottish Conservative chief whip John Lamont said: 'With housebreaking on the increase, officers should be out solving real crimes, rather than relying on Lego to try and prevent it.'\n\nThe pictures are part of an anti-housebreaking drive, Operation RAC. They were uploaded days after police vowed to target a group of 40 criminals suspected of fuelling the city's housebreaking problem.\n\nOne image shows a Lego figurine in a hat and standing beside a door. Another shows a man standing on a ledge with another figure below.\n\nPoems were posted alongside the pictures, with one reading: 'Staying in or goin oot? Lock the windaes 'n' front door. A simple step maybe, that'll prevent access tae them on the chore.'\n\n'Keep yer hame safe when yer oot on the go,\n\nBy usin' timers on lights 'n' even the radio,\n\nTimers are cheap 'n' it takes seconds tae do,\n\nAnd it cuid prevent ye fae calling the boys in blue.'\n\n'Look how ye get access tae the back o' yer hame,\n\nIf it's easy others wull dae the same, Restrict access tae the rear,\n\nAnd help prevent others fae choring yer gear.'\n\nOne victim of housebreaking, Tamara Swanson from Newhaven, Edinburgh, was not impressed.\n\nThe 20-year-old was alone in her home last July when an intruder attacked her as she was getting out of the shower. The man grabbed her from behind, punched her and then tried to strangle her before she managed to escape.\n\nSpeaking last night, she said police had done little to help her since the incident.\n\n'We had to keep phoning them [Police Scotland],' she said. 'I'm still going to a psychiatrist and they're putting a lot of anxiety down to this. I wasn't sleeping for months. I didn't feel safe at all.'\n\nSpeaking about the online campaign, she said: 'They're [people online] not going to look at it and think, ""That's interesting"" and do anything about it.'\n\nHer father, Peter Swanson, added: 'Why would they bother doing that? Lego? It's a joke. Police Scotland is a waste of time.\n\n'It's a money-saving thing, obviously to the detriment of policing. The cartoons are stupid. Get the guys back on the street.'\n\nAnother housebreaking victim, Michael Wright said the pictures were 'terrible' and 'insensitive'.\n\nHis house in the Inch area of Edinburgh was broken into just before Christmas, with thieves taking money he had set aside for presents, as well as his Ford Fiesta.\n\nMr Wright, whose young son was at home sleeping at the time of the incident, said: 'Could they not have used the resources elsewhere, rather than reconstructing scenes of burglaries with Lego sets?\n\n'When I saw that, I thought it was just insensitive to the victims of burglaries. They have nothing better to be doing than sitting behind their computer on Facebook.'\n\nWatch out: The campaign was shared on social media with fun poems. Pictures were uploaded days after police vowed to target a group of 40 criminals suspected of fuelling Edinburgh's housebreaking problem\n\nHe added: 'Most of the people who are being targeted are older folks in their 80s. They don't have Facebook or social media, so how are they supposed to get the message?'\n\nChief Supt Mark Williams, Edinburgh divisional commander, said: 'Over 354,000 people have already seen this campaign on social media giving us significant reach for crime prevention messages.\n\n'Social media is an important tool for communicating with the public.

The proper way to challenge it is through the right to review or a judicial review.\n\n'I'm confident that if they want to do that my decision will stand up. I thought long and hard before making it and I'm confident I got it right. My job is not to be populist. \n\n'The medical evidence was very clear. He wouldn't be fit to stand trial, he wouldn't understand the questions, he wouldn't understand the process, he wouldn't be able to understand instructions. \n\n'It's not to make decisions on the basis of what people want. It's about making the right decisions. Sometimes that means it won't be popular but if I'm fulfilling my duties as DPP that's the right thing to do.'\n\nPolice began investigating Lord Janner, pictured, after allegations of historic child-sex abuse were made but now he is too ill to be put on trial\n\nLast night it emerged Mrs Saunders overruled the advice of two of the country's most senior barristers to allow Lord Janner to avoid a trial.\n\nClare Montgomery QC and child abuse expert Eleanor Laws QC, leading counsel to the investigation, offered advice which could have supported a move to prosecute.\n\nIn particular, Mrs Laws pointed to overwhelming evidence and corroborating accounts by victims during the two-year police inquiry.\n\nBut Mrs Saunders decided it was not in the public interest to put Lord Janner in the dock due to his Alzheimer's disease.\n\nCampaigners, MPs and victims believe a 'trial of the facts' could have satisfied the need to get to the bottom of the appalling claims against the peer, whatever his mental state. \n\nAnd MailOnline revealed last week that 19 dementia sufferers have been prosecuted for child sex offences and ten were in the past year.\n\nThe Mail revealed today that Lord Janner signed over the deeds of his £2million home to his children at the height of the police paedophile case against him, it can be revealed.\n\nThe move puts his luxury apartment potentially out of reach of child abuse victims suing the Labour peer for compensation.\n\nThe flat, in an exclusive gated community near Hampstead Heath, North London, was transferred free of charge to his two daughters and son in March last year - the same month police raided Janner's Westminster office and three months after they had swooped on his home.\n\nIn the four years after he was diagnosed with Alzheimer's in 2009, the former Labour MP, 86, has claimed more than £100,000 in parliamentary expenses and allowances.\n\nLord Janner signed over the deeds of his £2 million flat in this complex to his children after the police raid\n\nEven earlier this month, on April 9, he was fit enough to sign a letter saying he wanted to remain in the House of Lords.\n\nA week later, the Crown Prosecution Service announced Janner would not be tried over child sex allegations because he was suffering so much from Alzheimer's that he could not even understand any charges against him, let alone answer them.\n\nThis was despite the fact the CPS ruled there was enough evidence to charge him with 22 sexual offences against children dating from 1969 to 1988.\n\nVictims have accused bungling authorities of helping to cover up the crimes of a once powerful man and destroying any hope they had of justice. Child protection campaigners, MPs, police and victims have vowed to challenge the decision in the courts.\n\nLast night, two senior Government figures joined the chorus of disapproval and said concerns over the decision were justified. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said there was something 'very strange' about the ruling and Health Minister Norman Lamb said the authorities should examine precedents of dementia sufferers being brought to trial.\n\nHe added that the matter should be brought before a court because Mrs Saunders and the Crown Prosecution Service had made 'heinous errors by failing to bring a prosecution earlier when there was evidence there to do so'.\n\nLast seen: Channel 4 News filmed Lord Jenner outside his house in London on July 8 2014, when he was last seen in public\n\nSigned: Dementia sufferer Lord Janner signed a letter on April 9, just a week after he was deemed unfit to stand trial. His signature has been redacted for privacy reasons\n\nMr Hunt said London Mayor Boris Johnson and Home Secretary Theresa May had been 'right' to express concern at the decision, adding: 'I think we all think that there is something very, very strange here where someone was signing official letters only a matter of weeks ago and is somehow escaping prosecution for something so incredibly serious.'\n\nLord Carlile, a Lib Dem peer and legal expert, said although there was strong evidence Lord Janner had dementia, the decision not to proceed with legal action should be reconsidered.\n\nThis week, leading politicians from seven parties demanded the decision be reversed. The group, led by Labour's Simon Danczuk, wrote to The Times: 'As long as justice is not seen to be done and the greater public interest is not served, the public will see attempts to investigate establishment figures involved in historic child abuse as a whitewash.'\n\nA CPS spokesman confirmed Mrs Laws advised Mrs Saunders to prosecute and that Mrs Montgomery was consulted on an 'ancillary matter'. At least ten men with dementia have been convicted of child sex offences since 2010.\n\nClare Montgomery QC, right and Eleanor Laws QC, left, both recommended Janner should face trial",Alison Saunders won't quit because 'making the right decision is not a resigning issue' head of CPS decided against pressing charges against Lord Janner..

The first involved 82 participants, half of whom took an acute dose of 1000 milligrams of acetaminophen and half who took an identical-looking placebo.\n\nThey then waited 60 minutes for the drug to take effect.\n\nParticipants then viewed 40 photographs selected from a database used by researchers around the world to elicit emotional responses.\n\nThe photographs ranged from the extremely unpleasant, to the neutral and the very pleasant.\n\nAfter viewing each photo, participants were asked to rate how positive or negative the photo was on a scale of -5 (extremely negative) to +5 (extremely positive).\n\nResults showed that participants who took acetaminophen rated all the photographs less extremely than did those who took the placebo. The researchers don't know if other pain relievers such as ibuprofen and aspirin have the same effect, although they plan on finding out in future research\n\nThey then viewed the same photos again and were asked to rate how much the photo made them feel an emotional reaction.\n\nResearchers are not exactly sure how Ty \n\nThe researchers don't know if other pain relievers such as ibuprofen and aspirin have the same effect, although they plan on studying that question.\n\nAcetaminophen, unlike many other pain relievers, is not a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, or NSAID.\n\nThat means it not thought to control inflammation in the body. Whether that fact has any relevance to possible emotional effects of the drugs is still an open question, the researchers added.\n\nIn this study, acetaminophen may have tapped into the sensitivity that makes some people react differently to both positive and negative life events.\n\n'There is accumulating evidence that some people are more sensitive to big life events of all kinds, rather than just vulnerable to bad events,' Durso said.\n\nResults showed that participants who took acetaminophen rated all the photographs less extremely than did those who took the placebo.\n\n'People who took acetaminophen didn't feel the same highs or lows as did the people who took placebos,' Way said.\n\nOne possibility is that acetaminophen changes how people judge magnitude.\n\nScientists claim acetaminophen may blunt individuals' broader judgments of everything, not just things having emotional content.\n\nThe researchers did a second study in which they had 85 people view the same photos and make the same judgments of evaluation and emotional reactions as in the prior study.\n\nParticipants in this second study also reported how much blue they saw in each photo.\n\nOnce again, individuals who took acetaminophen had emotional reactions to both negative and positive photographs that were significantly blunted.\n\nBut judgments of blue colour content were similar regardless of whether the participants took acetaminophen or not.\n\nAt this point, the researchers don't know if other pain relievers such as ibuprofen and aspirin have the same effect, although they plan on studying that question.\n\nAcetaminophen, unlike many other pain relievers, is not a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, or NSAID.\n\nThat means it not thought to control inflammation in the body.

We're still a long way from being able to cure HIV patients, but this study takes us one step closer, showing us what type of immune responses an effective vaccine should induce'\n\n'We need to be cautious in interpreting observations from a single subject,' said Dr Nilu Goonetilleke, who began working on the study at the University of Oxford and is now at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. \n\n'However, demonstration even from a single subject, that our immune system can rapidly control HIV-1 tells us a lot about the types of immune responses we should target and augment through vaccination.'\n\nDr Gupta adds: 'Drugs to stimulate reactivation of dormant HIV are still imperfect, and we do not know if they would be able to flush out all of the HIV from the body. \n\n'Likewise, it remains to be seen whether a vaccine could enable a normal HIV patient's immune system to kill HIV with the full strength of an elite controller. \n\n'Our study is a proof of principle and the results are promising, but it is unlikely to lead to a cure for at least a decade.'\n\nThe study was published in the journal Clinical Infectious Diseases.","Scientists believe future vaccine could trigger body's immune system..

The Scottish National Party has pledged to vote in favour of a 50p top rate if it holds the balance of power after May 7.\n\nBut Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls is said to want the new top rate to be temporary, while Mr Miliband is more ideologically wedded to maintaining it. \n\nDuring the Labour leadership race in 2010, Mr Miliband said the 50p rate should stay in place and was 'not just about reducing the deficit, it's about fairness in our society'.\n\nToday, in an interview with with the New Statesman magazine, shadow business secretary Mr Umunna broke ranks to insist that how long to sustain the measure should be a purely economic decision and not a moral one.\n\n'I wouldn't want to do it permanently because ... I would like to see the tax burden as low as possible,' he said. 'I don't believe that you tax for the sake of taxing: you tax to fund public services and, currently, to reduce our deficit and our debt.\n\n'I'm very clear: I did not go into politics to tax people. We should be very clear about that as a party.'\n\nShadow Chancellor Ed Balls, speaking in Birmingham today, is said to want the new top rate to be temporary, while Mr Miliband is more ideologically wedded to maintaining it\n\nDuring the Labour leadership race in 2010, Ed Miliband - pictured campaigning in north London today, said the 50p rate should stay in place and was 'not just about reducing the deficit, it's about fairness in our society'\n\nMr Umunna also argued that Labour needs to make a more positive and confident case for reducing the deficit in order to cope with the Left-wing backlash it would encounter in office.\n\n'I don't think there is anything progressive in spending more on your debt interest repayments every year than you do on housing, than you do on transport,' he said. 'That is where there is an argument from a progressive position to be made for balancing the books. We need to make that argument and we need to make it more confidently.\n\n'Because if we get elected . . . we're going to have to make some really tough decisions. And we need to be clear why we're doing this - we will be attacked from the left, not just by the Green Party but the Socialist Party and others, and we've got to have a confident, not a defensive position.'\n\nAsked whether he would like to be Labour leader, Mr Umunna failed to rule it out. 'I always listen to Tessa Jowell, who's like my political mum, who says you've got to keep your feet firmly on the ground and for every person who writes up something like that there'll be another slagging you off,' said the 36-year-old.\n\n'So I think you've got to keep a sense of perspective and you've got to remember in politics that it isn't about you, it's actually about the ideas, the arguments and the party.'\n\nMr Balls yesterday published an audit of spending and tax commitments in the Conservative Party manifesto which he claims shows the Tories have made £25 billion a year of promises which they have not explained how they will pay for.\n\nIn a speech in the West Midlands, Labour's Shadow Chancellor will say that this £25 billion is the equivalent of £1,439 a year for every working household in Britain.\n\n'The Conservative Party manifesto contains billions of pounds of panicky promises with absolutely no idea where the money is coming from,' he said.\n\nChancellor George Osborne has rejected Mr Balls's criticisms of the Tory manifesto as 'absurd'. He has refused to rule out reducing the top tax rate back down to 40p, where it was during Tony Blair's entire period of office.",Mr Umunna said he was opposed to 'taxing for the sake of taxing' business secretary said re-introduction of the rate should be temporary.. His remarks highlighted divisions in Labour's top ranks over the 50p rate.. Ed Miliband said the 50p top rate of tax was 'about fairness in our society',['The only thing this summary does not cover are the oppositions to the temporary 50p tax.

Coltrane on TV's ""The Dukes of Hazzard,"" died Monday after a brief illness. He was 88.\n\nBest died in hospice in Hickory, North Carolina, of complications from pneumonia, said Steve Latshaw, a longtime friend and Hollywood colleague.\n\nAlthough he'd been a busy actor for decades in theater and in Hollywood, Best didn't become famous until 1979, when ""The Dukes of Hazzard's"" cornpone charms began beaming into millions of American homes almost every Friday night.\n\nFor seven seasons, Best's Rosco P. Coltrane chased the moonshine-running Duke boys back and forth across the back roads of fictitious Hazzard County, Georgia, although his ""hot pursuit"" usually ended with him crashing his patrol car.\n\nAlthough Rosco was slow-witted and corrupt, Best gave him a childlike enthusiasm that got laughs and made him endearing. His character became known for his distinctive ""kew-kew-kew"" chuckle and for goofy catchphrases such as ""cuff 'em and stuff 'em!"" upon making an arrest.\n\nAmong the most popular shows on TV in the early '80s, ""The Dukes of Hazzard"" ran until 1985 and spawned TV movies, an animated series and video games.\n\nSeveral of Best's ""Hazzard"" co-stars paid tribute to the late actor on social media.\n\n""I laughed and learned more from Jimmie in one hour than from anyone else in a whole year,"" co-star John Schneider, who played Bo Duke, said on Twitter. ""Give Uncle Jesse my love when you see him dear friend.""\n\n""Jimmy Best was the most constantly creative person I have ever known,"" said Ben Jones, who played mechanic Cooter on the show, in a Facebook post. ""Every minute of his long life was spent acting, writing, producing, painting, teaching, fishing, or involved in another of his life's many passions.""\n\nBorn Jewel Guy on July 26, 1926, in Powderly, Kentucky, Best was orphaned at 3 and adopted by Armen and Essa Best, who renamed him James and raised him in rural Indiana. Best served in the Army during World War II before launching his acting career.\n\nIn the 1950s and 1960s, he accumulated scores of credits, playing a range of colorful supporting characters in such TV shows as ""The Twilight Zone,"" ""Bonanza,"" ""The Andy Griffith Show"" and ""Gunsmoke."" He later appeared in a handful of Burt Reynolds' movies, including ""Hooper"" and ""The End.""\n\nBut Best will always be best known for his ""Hazzard"" role, which lives on in reruns.\n\n""Jimmie was my teacher, mentor, close friend and collaborator for 26 years,"" Latshaw said. ""I directed two of his feature films, including the recent 'Return of the Killer Shrews,' a sequel he co-wrote and was quite proud of as he had made the first one more than 50 years earlier.""\n\nPeople we've lost in 2015\n\nCNN's Stella Chan contributed to this story.","James Best, who played the sheriff on ""the Dukes of Hazzard,"" died Monday at 88..

Twin study suggests they might be - depending on the party you support\nAs a society we believe that our political allegiance depends on which party best marries up with our needs and values, and that these are shaped by our life experiences. \n\nBut research with twins suggests picking who to vote for in an election might have more to do with your genes than the policies of the parties.\n\nTo put this to the test, the Department of Twin Research, which hosts the biggest adult twin registry in the UK, recently performed a poll of voting preferences.\n\nDeciding who you will vote for may have more to do with your family than who won the leaders debate (above) finds study which looked at the voting habits of twins born in the UK. The aim was to explore how much nature and nurture influence our party political allegiances and potential voting preferences\n\nThe twins were all born in the UK and were broadly representative of the UK population. \n\nThe aim was to explore how much nature and nurture influence our party political allegiances and potential voting preferences so we can draw broader conclusions about people's voting habits.\n\nTwins provide a unique natural experiment for research. \n\nIdentical twins share 100 per cent of their genes, while non-identical twins - like non-twin siblings - share about 50 per cent. \n\nBoth identical and non-identical twins normally share the same environment while growing up. \n\nTwin studies are useful for exploring whether a trait is forged in the genes, passed down or by the environment a person is living in.\n\nAs identical twins share exactly the same DNA, traits produced by genes should appear in both twins.\n\nHowever in non-identical twins the DNA will not be the same and so differences can occur.\n\nIn most cases twins should have shared the same environment when growing up too.\n\nSo by comparing the differences and similarities between identical and non-identical twins it may be possible to unravel whether a trait is environmental or cultural.\n\nHowever, as twins grow up they can be influenced by different groups of friends, cultural experiences and points of view.\n\nThis can make it difficult to unpick the influence of environment over genetics.\n\nIn the case of political views, these can also run strongly in families as they tend to share the same socioeconomic background and parents can often impress their political support upon their children.\n\nHowever, the study of twins found identical twins were more likely to vote the same way than the non-identical twins. \n\nAssuming they had similar upbringings and experiences through adulthood, this would suggest there is an underlying genetic influence for political alignment.\n\nBy comparing the differences and similarities between them the researchers said they can identify how much of a quirk, disease, or trait is due to a genetic predisposition or environmental and cultural factors. \n\nBecause twin studies adjust for culture and upbringing, they are an ideal way to study political allegiances.\n\nThe researchers analysed surveys completed by 2,355 twins (comprising responses from 612 full pairs) in March 2015 between the ages of 18 and 80 - most of whom were middle aged. \n\nThey told the researchers whether they intended to vote, what their political party of choice was, and provided their personal rating of the main party leaders.\n\nThey found that voting Conservative, or not, is strongly influenced by genetics. \n\nWhen it came to voting Tory, they found that 57 per cent of the variability - differences or similarity - between people's voting preferences were due to genetic effects. This percentage is called heritability. \n\nThat means the identical twins were more likely to vote the same way than the non-identical twins - suggesting an underlying genetic influence was stronger than environmental or random factors.\n\nFor UKIP voting preferences, there was also a moderately strong heritability of 51 per cent. This was closely followed by Labour and the Green Party both with 48 per cent.\n\nThe exception seemed to be voting for the Liberal Democrats, which was affected entirely by environment with no genetic influence. \n\nIdentical twins showed exactly the same level of disparity in preference for the Lib Dems as non-identical twins. \n\nGeography also played a possible role - as voting for the SNP in Scotland was also completely environmental.\n\nThese latest results from UK data confirm the trends found in previous research carried out in the US.\n\nThe researchers analysed surveys completed by 2,355 twins in March 2015 between the ages of 18 and 80 - most of whom were middle aged. They told the researchers whether they intended to vote, what their political party of choice was, and provided their personal rating of the main party leaders\n\nVoting for the Conservative Party, led by David Cameron, pictured above after voting at the last General Election with his wife Samantha, tended to have the strongest heritability according to a study of UK twins\n\nA 2008 survey of 682 pairs of middle-aged twins from the Minnesota Twin Registry showed that self-reported political ideology and right-wing authoritarianism were consistently more similar in the identical twins than fraternal twins.\n\nPrevious studies have also shown strong genetic influences on right-wing views, be they for or against.\n\n'We and others have demonstrated consistent genetic influences on all measurable aspects of our personalities,' said the researchers. \n\n'The consensus is that these political leanings are mainly due to the genetic makeup of our underlying personalities.'\n\n'Despite this, our survey shows that whether we intend to vote or not does not seem to be influenced by genes and personality. That decision appears to be entirely shaped by environmental factors.'\n\nThe popularity of Nick Clegg (above), leader of the Liberal Democrats seemed to be heritable, although voting for this party was not heritability and appeared to be influenced by the environment alone, the study showed\n\nThe question of whether a leader would make a good prime minister produced mixed responses. \n\nDavid Cameron had the stronger genetic influence on opinions, with 50 per cent heritability, followed by Nick Clegg at 37 per cent. \n\nViews on all the other party leaders were purely environmental.\n\nPsychology studies have shown our sub-conscious biases for leaders who are tall and with round symmetrical faces so maybe this also plays a role in our choices.\n\nBut even if we do see party leaders differently, the findings of this study suggest that our choices at the polling booth may not be as free or rational as we would like to believe. Something to think about when you approach the ballot box.\n\nProfessor Tim Spector is the Professor of Genetic Epidemiology at King's College London\n\nVictoria Vazquez also contributed to this article.","Study of twins in the UK found voting Conservative tends to run in families..

Durst is pictured here last month in New Orleans\n\nAttorney Dick DeGuerin whispered into Durst's ear as he entered the plea. He had to whisper twice before Durst said, 'I am not guilty, your honor.'\n\nJudge Franz Zibilich asked if Durst was making that plea to both charges against him. DeGuerin whispered again, and Durst said, 'Yes, your honor.'\n\nThe weapons arrest has kept Durst in New Orleans even though he waived extradition to California, where he's charged in the December 2000 death of a longtime friend. Durst is being held without bail in the mental ward of a state prison.\n\nDurst's story also is playing out two miles away in federal court in New Orleans. An affidavit filed there accuses Durst of breaking a federal law prohibiting felons from possessing firearms. Prosecutors have asked a U.S. magistrate judge to order Durst to be brought to federal court for a hearing next Thursday — and that he remain in U.S. custody until the federal matter is resolved.\n\nDurst, an estranged member of the family that runs 1 World Trade Center in New York, has had multiple run-ins with the law over his nearly 72 years.\n\nHe was arrested in New Orleans last month on the eve of the finale of a six-part HBO documentary called 'The Jinx' about Durst, the disappearance of his first wife in 1982, the death of a longtime friend in 2000 and the death and dismemberment of a neighbor in Galveston in 2001.\n\nMurdered: Susan Berman, who acted as a media spokesperson for Durst in the wake of his wife's disappearance, was shot in the head at her LA home in 2000, just as the cold case into the disappearance of Kathleen Durst was reopened. Durst was charged with Berman's murder last month \n\nA self-defense plea won acquittal in the death of Morris Black, but Durst is charged in Los Angeles with murder in the death of longtime friend Susan Berman, 55, who was shot in the head in 2000. \n\nBerman, an author, acted as a media spokesperson for Durst in the wake of his wife's disappearance. \n\nThe Jinx suggested she knew a lot about Durst. \n\nHer death coincided with the cold case of Kathleen Durst's disappearance being reopened. \n\nDurst's lawyers, DeGuerin and Billy Gibbens, have said repeatedly that he just wants to go to California to deal with that charge.\n\nThey also have challenged the weapons charges on several grounds, including the allegation that the FBI 'rummaged' through Durst's belongings before getting an arrest or search warrant.\n\nBut Andrea Armstrong, a criminal law professor at Loyola University in New Orleans, said Wednesday that 'the fact that it was warrantless doesn't necessarily mean it was unconstitutional.'\n\nThere are at least 11 circumstances, starting with consent, that make it legal to search without a warrant, she said.\n\nDeGuerin also has argued that the two felonies to which Durst pleaded guilty in Pennsylvania — possessing a firearm while a fugitive and doing so while under indictment — are not among those that would make it illegal for him to have a gun.\n\nUntil his indictment Wednesday, Durst had been arrested but not formally charged in connection with the .38-caliber revolver authorities say was found in his room at the J.W. Marriott, where he was staying under the name Everette Ward.\n\nAccording to court testimony, an FBI agent recognized Durst in a New Orleans hotel March 14 and escorted him to his hotel room. \n\nDurst was arrested early March 15 on the Los Angeles warrant and arrested separately on the weapons charges the next day.\n\nDurst's lawyers say the arrest in New Orleans was timed to coincide with the final episode of 'The Jinx,' which also described the disappearance of his wife, Kathleen, in 1982 from New York; the Los Angeles shooting of Berman, 55, in 2000; and Black's death in 2001.","Robert Durst was indicted Wednesday on the two weapons charges that have kept him in New Orleans..

Defender Bartra added a third and Suarez scored his second with the last kick of the game as Barcelona stayed clear at the top with now just eight matches to play.\n\nSuarez deserved his second half goals having been the brightest light for the home side early on. When a Rakitic through-ball put him in he should have scored. Perhaps surprised by the fact that the flag had not been raised his shot was smothered by Cuesta.\n\nAlmeria were playing their first game under the management of Sergi Barjuan who played over 400 games for Barça and coached in their youth academy when his opposite number Luis Enrique was in charger of the B-team.\n\nThey almost scored with a Wellington Silva cross-shot that just crept past Claudio Bravo's far post after Pedro got a touch to it. They were breaking quickly with the pace of former West Brom loanee Thievy Bifouma always a threat.\n\nBarcelona responded with Sergio Roberto finding Messi in space on the right but after he accelerated into the area he gave possession away with an uncharacteristically heavy touch.\n\nPedro wrapped a cross-shot just wide of Cuesta's goal but still there was no breakthrough. It should have come on 24 minutes.  \n\nAlmeria keeper Julian Cuesta uses any means necessary to keep the ball away from former Liverpool forward Luis Suarez (left)\n\nBarcelona stalwart Xavi (right) watches on as team-mate Messi tries a rare attempt using his head\n\nSpain international Pedro (centre) was given an opportunity after Neymar was dropped to the bench to cope with hectic schedule\n\nEveryone on the pitch can only watch as Messi's stunning left-foot strike curls into the bottom corner of the net\n\nBrazil full-back Dani Alves rushes to congratulate team-mate Messi after he gives Barcelona a first half lead\n\nThe Argentina phenomenon celebrates scoring his 33rd league goal of the season so far\n\nBarcelona were without Neymar, resting on the bench alongside Gerard Pique, but Messi, Suarez and Pedro should have linked to score on 24 minutes. Messi weaved in from the right flank, Suarez got the better of Angel Trujillo and pulled the ball back across the face of the six-yard box but Pedro failed to anticipate the pass and it ran to safety.\n\nIt looked as if Barcelona would reach half-time without the breakthrough then Messi broke through and Almeria's resistance was broken for good.\n\nThievy raced away and Mascherano risked a straight red by barging him off the ball as he looked like leaving the Argentine and the covering Sergi Roberto behind. He was shown a yellow and Almeria wasted the free-kick but they offered little going forward after the break.\n\nWhen Suarez scored 10 minutes into the second half only Barcelona's unwillingness to go up through the gears kept the score down. Bartra headed in goal number three with what was Barcelona's 14th set-piece goal of the season before Suarez made it four.\n\nWith set-piece strikes Coach Luis Enrique and his assistant Juan Carlos Unzue have managed to add a new weapon to the Barcelona armoury.

Poor standards in many care homes and reduced home help could also prompt early deaths, experts say.\n\nThe deterioration follows three decades in which annual average life expectancy has increased by 1.2 per cent for men aged 65 and 0.7 per cent for women.\n\nThe study by Public Health England said it was too early to say whether the change was a long-term one.\n\nProfessor John Ashton, president of the UK Faculty of Public Health, said: 'One of the issues we have seen is women living lifestyle's becoming more like those of men over recent decades, with more smoking and drinking.'\n\nScroll down for video \n\nHe also suggested the falls could reflect cutbacks in social care, which he said had been 'hammered' in recent years.\n\nRecent governments had failed to invest in care for an ageing population, Professor Ashton said, leaving insufficient help for the frail and vulnerable.\n\nHe added: 'There has been a failure of successive governments in that we should have seen that trends were changing, that more people would be living longer and we needed to put services in place to look after them.\n\n'We are letting down a generation which came back from the war and built the welfare state.'\n\nBy 2013, the average 75-year-old woman could expect to live another 13 years and five weeks – five weeks less than in 2011, a Government report shows\n\nPublic Health England said the fall among women aged 65 was the first since 1995, while that among those aged 75 had not been seen for nine years. It called the falls statistically significant.\n\nSince then, the figures for women in their sixties have recovered to their 2011 level, but the 2013 statistics for older women remained worse than those two years earlier.\n\nIt means average life expectancy for a women of 85 is now two and a half months shorter than in 2011. Health officials need a third year's data to establish whether the figures from 2012 and 2013 mean life expectancy is levelling off or entering a more worrying decline.\n\nThe report said: 'Within England, although female life expectancy at all four ages fell in 2012, and for males it fell at ages 85 and 95 and remained static at ages 65 and 75, it is too early to say whether this represents a slowing in the upward trend or the start of a downward trend.'\n\nPublic Health England said the impact of the recession could be one reason why life expectancy fell in several European countries. Flu outbreaks and cold winters may also be to blame.\n\nCaroline Abrahams, of the charity Age UK, said: 'This decrease in life expectancy, after many years of improvement, is like the canary in the coal mine. It is telling us that something has changed for the worse, so that fewer people are thriving in later life than they could or should.\n\n'The most likely culprit is the rapid decline of state-funded social care in recent years, which is leaving hundreds of thousands of older people to struggle on alone at home without any help.\n\n'This decrease in life expectancy, after many years of improvement, is like the canary in the coal mine'\n\n'More and more older people are living with several incurable conditions and illnesses. Determined action now to sustain social care and to support older people with multiple long-term health conditions more effectively can hopefully make this a blip, rather than the start of a terrible trend.'\n\nDespite the new figures, a 65-year-old man in the UK can expect to live 18 years and six months – still almost five and a half more years than 30 years ago. A woman of the same age can expect 21 more years – a gain of almost four years in the last three decades.\n\nMen of 75 can now expect to live 11 years and 15 weeks, with 13 years five weeks for women, while at 85, men can expect five years and 42 weeks, and women six years and 42 weeks.","Predicted life spans of women aged 65, 75, 85 and 95 fell in 2012..

By using just moss he is able to generate enough power to run a clock (shown). He said panels of plant material could power appliances in our homes. And the technology could help farmers grow crops where electricity is scarce\n\nDr Paolo Bombelli will present his research as part of the Pint of Science festival, which is running from 18 to 20 May in 50 cities across nine countries.\n\nHis idea is relatively simple - by wiring up plants to an electro-chemical system, he is able to harness the waste electrons and energy produced during the photosynthesis process.\n\nAnd the results are surprisingly efficient. He demonstrated how a smartphone-sized block of moss could be used to power a digital clock. \n\nThe Pint of Science festival is taking place from Monday 18 to Wednesday 20 May 2015.\n\nIt sees scientists of various disciplines give talks in pubs around the world, with topics ranging from the brain to space, that the public can attend for £3 - the 'price of a pint'.\n\nDr Paolo Bombelli, with his moss-powered clock, is one of the scientists taking part.\n\nThis year more than 600 science evenings will take place in 50 cities across nine countries.\n\nCities in the UK include Bristol, London, Manchester and Southampton.\n\nA full schedule can be found on their website.\n\nAn A4-sized area of leaves - about 93 square inches (600 square centimetres) - could charge four AA batteries in one hour on a typical sunny day.\n\nDr Bombelli said his inspiration came from the movie The Matrix.\n\n'In that movie, they try to generate electrical energy, power, from humans,' he explained.\n\n'And although it was a bit crude, the concept is actually correct.\n\n'But there are perhaps less ethical issues if you take electrons from photosynthetic organisms than humans.'\n\nThe apparatus required is also relatively simple - cables, some water and a plant.\n\nAt the moment, Dr Bombelli is trying to find a way to increase the 'flux' of electrons emitted by a plant, making more energy available.\n\n'If we can crack this, we can get a very large flux of electrons coming out, then we can build a biological solar panel,' he told MailOnline.\n\nDr Bombelli said his inspiration came from the 1999 movie The Matrix. 'In that movie, they try to generate electrical energy, power, from humans,' he explained, shown in this image from the movie. 'But there are perhaps less ethical issues if you take electrons from photosynthetic organisms than humans'\n\nAn A4-sized area of leaves - about (93 square inches (600 square centimetres) - could charge four AA batteries in one hour on a typical sunny day. The ultimate goal is to develop panels that generate five watts per square metre (11 square ft). By comparison, a solar panel generates 150 to 200 watts per square metre\n\nDr Paolo Bombelli  presented his research at a preview  of the Pint of Science festival (left). He is adamant that regular moss (stock image right) could provide an additional source of renewable energy to complement others that are available\n\nFor example, he said people could have one of these panels on the roof of their house to power certain appliances in their home. The goal is to generate up to five watts per square metre (11 square feet).\n\nBy comparison, a solar panel generates 150 to 200 watts per square metre. \n\nThe uses are not just in the home, though. Dr Bombelli said in regions where people don't have access to energy, biological solar panels could be useful for tasks such as growing crops.\n\nPeople could be shown how to build the simple systems and, unlike solar panels which require technical expertise to fix, the biological solar panels can be fixed easily. \n\n'To assemble one is not too difficult,' he explained.\n\nAnd to demonstrate just how useful the technology can be, Dr Bombelli is gearing up to deploy a plant-powered system in London Zoo.\n\nA trap camera powered by moss will be installed in the next four to eight weeks, and ultimately the same camera could be used to capture images of animals in the wild.\n\nRice farming is one area Dr Bombelli sees his technology being useful. It could help power technology in areas where electricity is scarce, possibly increasing yields. Shown is a stock image of rice paddy fields in India, one region Dr Bombelli said his technology could be useful\n\nHe noted that there are limitations: the technology is not very mobile, and its power output is low compared to other renewable energies.\n\nNonetheless he thinks it could be part of a 'portfolio of renewable technology' to generate electricity.\n\n'We don't really think the world is going to be powered by this technology, but it could play a role,' he said.",University of Cambridge scientist has revealed his green source of energy..

Nicole, a 30-year-old woman, doesn't have to imagine this scenario because it's her everyday reality.  The small and unusual living space is all that this employed, single mother can afford in her high-cost community in San Mateo, California.\n\nNicole isn't alone in her struggles.\n\nCNN recently published a powerful piece called ""Poor kids of Silicon Valley"" that documents the affordable housing challenges facing families in the Bay Area.  One aspect featured a house that is home to 16 people, including 11 children.  Another chronicles a husband and wife named Rich and Stacey, both of whom have jobs, who are living in a San Jose homeless shelter with their two kids because they don't have the money to go anywhere else.\n\nAlthough Silicon Valley has unique characteristics, it isn't the only community confronting these challenges.  Our entire nation is in the midst of an affordable housing crisis.  The agency I lead, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, recently released a report estimating that 7.7 million low-income households live in substandard housing, spend more than half their incomes on rent or both.\n\nThese are families who are dedicating $1 out of every $2 they earn just to keep a roof over their head.  And the more they spend on housing, the less they have to invest in their children's education, build up savings and shop at local businesses.  These are outcomes that hurt our nation's economy and require us to respond with swift and bold action.\n\nHUD is working with local partners across the country to do just that.\n\nFirst, we're focusing on preserving the affordable housing that already exists. Since the mid-1970s, we have directed and insured loans for multifamily properties that have resulted in more than 700,000 affordable units.  But by 2020, we're in danger of losing more than 125,000 because these mortgages are maturing, ending agreements to control rents in these units.  So we've launched a preservation effort with private partners to keep these properties affordable for generations to come.\n\nWe're also doing the same with public housing. Right now, the nation is losing 10,000 units of public housing every year, mainly because of disrepair, HUD created the Rental Assistance Demonstration  initiative to bring private investment into the fold for the public good.\n\nIt's cost neutral for the federal government and making a big impact for communities such as Lexington, North Carolina, where the local housing authority is making 58 years' worth of repairs in just 22 months, including new lighting, modern windows and better insulation to help residents stay warm and cut energy costs.\n\nRAD has allowed local communities to raise more than $733 million in new capital to date. That's why we're asking Congress to give every community the chance to participate by lifting the restrictions on this program. No American should ever have to wait six decades to have a decent and healthy place to call home.\n\nIn addition to preservation, HUD is also working to create new affordable housing.  A Harvard study revealed that in 2012, there were 11.5 million extremely low-income households and only 3.3 million affordable units available.  It's clear that we can't preserve our way out of this problem.  We've got to grow the supply to meet demand, so HUD is taking a multifaceted approach.\n\nFor example, our HOME Investment Partnerships Program is leveraging $4 in private and other public resources for every $1 in HOME funds and leading to more than 1 million new and rehabilitated units for rent or sale to lower income families.\n\nThis is more than just a statistic: It is progress for people, from the families living in the Broadway Crossing development in Washington to the seniors living in the Woodcrest Retirement Residence in Pennsylvania.  To keep this momentum going, we've asked Congress to increase HOME funding by 16% to keep building affordable homes, prosperous partnerships and strong communities across the nation.\n\nWe are also asking Congress to expand our Housing Choice Voucher Program, which allows recipients of modest means, the elderly, and people with disabilities to find housing in the private market.  This includes restoring 67,000 vouchers that were lost to sequestration.\n\nAnd we're targeting our resources where they can have a big impact.\n\nFor instance, HUD awarded $94 million in targeted homelessness assistance to 274 programs across the San Francisco Bay Area, including Silicon Valley, in January.  And we continue to work with local partners to encourage private investment. To empower communities, President Barack Obama has also requested $300 million for new Local Housing Policy Grants to help them increase housing affordability, economic growth and access to jobs. All of this work is making a significant contribution to families and communities from coast-to-coast.\n\nOur nation's affordable housing challenges won't be solved overnight, and we still need to do more to make sure that more folks are able to prosper. Let's not squander this chance to make real progress for American families. Incredible things can happen when a wide variety of leaders come together for the common good.\n\nBy leveraging private investment and increasing collaboration with state, local and tribal governments and other traditional housing partners, I know we can build a future where affordable housing is available to all.","Cnn's john sutter told the story of the ""poor kids of Silicon Valley"" hud secretary julián castro: our shortage of affordable Housing is a national crisis that stunts the economy.",['Information in the summary that is not in the article.'],0.2528668186223226,0.0,0.19474079972597902,0.9999999999999999,0.3219513829937839,0.25551384991333814,0.6027913835637976,0.7916362971956263,0.3026755619040752,0.0,0.5602913305042821,0.0,0.2860036764368612,0.0379470862232516,0.011818357406728847,0.00986193545934963,0.01993099644537255,0.0,0.0,0.0174377729293676,0.027216866914392457,0.023719275264479436,0.2882798489165075

It wasn't Frances Hodgson Burnett's 1911 novel about a sour little girl's magical place, making a book club comeback.\n\nIt was a similarly named coloring book that adults were buying, for themselves, and it wasn't the only one in the top 10.\n\nJohanna Basford's ""Secret Garden: An Inky Treasure Hunt & Coloring Book"" (now at No. 3 on Amazon) along with her second effort, ""Enchanted Forest: An Inky Quest & Coloring Book"" (No. 6); ""Balance (Angie's Extreme Stress Menders Volume 1)"" by Angie Grace (No. 9); and ""The Mindfulness Colouring Book: Anti-stress Art Therapy for Busy People"" by Emma Farrarons (No. 8 on Amazon UK) are selling at a rapid clip.\n\nThough they can be used by kids, these and other new coloring book titles are being marketed to stressed-out, work-addled adults, who want to benefit from the quiet zen that a coloring session can bring.\n\n""Adult coloring is absolutely a growing trend and consumers are really taking to the idea,"" Farrarons' U.S. publisher, Matthew Lore of The Experiment publishing group, wrote in an email. ""Not only is it calming and good for your health, it's just fun! The demand is increasing exponentially as the word spreads.""\n\nWhile Farrarons and Basford are based in the UK, the concept is taking off in the U.S. too, with the publication of titles like Virginia-based art therapist Lacy Mucklow and illustrator Angela Porter's ""Color Me Calm"" and ""Color Me Happy,"" created for the minds and motor skills of Mom and Dad, not the kids.\n\nThe trend doesn't seem to be letting up. Basford is working on a third title, Farrarons has been commissioned for a second book, and Mucklow and Porter will release ""Color Me Stress-Free"" in September.\n\nAdults have long used crafts to unwind, but why coloring books? Why now? It may have something to do with online access -- and, funnily enough, the desire to unplug.\n\nOrdering a coloring book that suits adult tastes online is easier than walking into a bookstore where the only options have Barbie or Thomas the Tank Engine themes. Plus, everyone's favorite online crafting hub, Pinterest, is a treasure trove of adult coloring pages, with themes ranging from nature and animals to classic paintings.\n\nMeanwhile, like children, adults need a break from screen time -- and many are rediscovering the analog pleasures of coloring inside the lines.\n\n""I'm a grown-up, but I still love coloring books,"" novelist Matt Cain proclaimed in a piece for The Guardian.\n\n""If I switch off the phone, computer and TV and concentrate solely on choosing the right shade of blue, avoiding going over the lines and slowly filling up my page with colour, all my other concerns, I've discovered, fade to nothing,"" Cain wrote.\n\nThe therapeutic benefits of art are nothing new; it's a concept that practitioners use with patients of all ages.\n\nAtlanta-based art therapist Susanne Fincher, who has published several coloring books, said coloring can lift the mood, reduce anxiety and relieve stress.\n\n""Art making is a powerful intervention,"" Fincher wrote in an email. ""Neuroscientific research has shown that through the use of art therapy, the human brain can physically change, grow, and rejuvenate.""\n\nTrue art therapy, she warned, should be administered only by a qualified professional.\n\nMindfulness and meditative coloring are recurring themes in the growing adult coloring book industry. A search for ""adult coloring books"" on Amazon or Barnes and Noble will yield several books of mandalas, a ritual symbol in Buddhism and Hinduism that represents the universe, waiting to be colored in.\n\n""I sometimes give clients one of my mandala coloring books for homework between sessions with me,"" Fincher wrote. ""Coloring mandalas can empower a client to manage thoughts and feelings on their own with the positive activity of coloring, instead of, for example, overeating or abusing substances.""\n\nThe opportunity to craft a mindfulness coloring book for adults was serendipitous for illustrator Farrarons, who had been practicing mindfulness for a few years before getting the offer to create a book.\n\n""In mindfulness, it is encouraged to break patterns in life by introducing variation to avoid the sensation of being on autopilot,"" Farrarons wrote in an email while on holiday in Korea. ""Each page has been caringly designed with this in mind, so that the person coloring can hop at random from one pattern to the next. ""\n\nColoring books like Farrarons' pocket-sized volume bring a bit of calming and spirituality to the masses, but for some adult enthusiasts coloring is just a fun throwback to a simpler time, she added.\n\n""It reminds me of hours spent filling in scenes from a coloring book as a little girl. In the digital age that we are in, surely, it can only be a good thing to pick up a pencil and feel young again.""","Coloring books made for adults are popular on Amazon's bestselling books list..

The impasse has left fans in the dark, and ticket brokers perplexed.\n\nFloyd Mayweather performs at a media workout with his uncle Roger on the pads in Las Vegas \n\nManny Pacquiao was in good spirits as he showed off his skills for the fans earlier this week\n\n'It's bizarre, normally there's a public sale 10 weeks before the fight,' said Connor Gregoire, an analyst for Seatgeek.com. 'To our knowledge no one has a printed ticket in their hands right now.'\n\nMayweather's promoter, Leonard Ellerbe, said Tuesday that tickets would go on sale this week for the May 2 fight, but MGM officials have been tight-lipped about their availability. The hotel issued a statement Friday saying there would be a 'limited number of tickets available for sale' and that it is working with promoters to finalize a date for their release.\n\nThe fight was always going to be a tough ticket, with announced prices of £1,000 to £5,000 in the 16,500-seat Grand Garden arena. But those prices have already tripled in the resale market even before tickets are available, and the two camps and the MGM have been bickering over how many seats - and at what price level - each party gets.\n\nPacquiao's manager, Michael Koncz, blamed the Mayweather camp for holding up the ticket sales, saying they have refused to sign a term sheet negotiated months earlier that specified the allotments.\n\n'It's a real mess right now,' Koncz said. 'I can only surmise the motivation is greed and an attempt to manipulate the tickets, otherwise why the holdup? I'm more than a little upset they're not for sale to the public.'\n\nMillions of dollars are at stake in the dispute, because after the MGM takes its share each camp gets a certain percentage of tickets and is able to resell them with ticket brokers for higher prices. The estimated gate for the tickets if they are sold at retail prices is already a staggering £48million, far surpassing the previous gate record of £13.3million for Mayweather's 2013 fight with Canelo Alvarez.\n\nPacquiao used Instagram to show his fans a photo of his ripped body as he continues his preparation\n\nPromoter Bob Arum said he has heard of people cancelling their reservations to Las Vegas because they're afraid they can't get tickets.\n\n'This is not acceptable,' said Arum, who promotes Pacquiao. 'This is a worldwide event that the city of Las Vegas is involved in. It's one of the craziest things I've ever seen.'\n\nGregoire said the fight is one of Seatgeek's most searched events, but that only a few dozen tickets have been sold through the website. Those tickets are what the ticket industry calls 'spec tickets' because the sellers don't actually have them in hand, but expect to get them before the fight.\n\nThe Filipino fighter is looking to put an end to Mayweather's current unbeaten record in the ring\n\nThe cheapest seat on the site on Friday was £3,200, and Gregoire said the average sale so far is in the £5,300 range.\n\n'People are hesitant to buy in the secondary market before there's been an original sale,' he said. 'And you've also got the incredible prices being asked for tickets now. That means a lot of people are not buying tickets at this point.'\n\nAt Stubhub there are no tickets for sale, spokeswoman Alison Salcedo said, because the ticket reseller is waiting for actual prices to be set and tickets to be printed.\n\nMusic artist Liljamez posted the photo of 'Money' with just over two weeks to go until the bout\n\n'There's still so much up in the air for this fight that we're not allowing spec sales,' Salcedo said. 'We're not willing to take that risk now.'\n\nTickets have also not gone on sale for the closed circuit telecast of the fight at the various MGM properties in Las Vegas. Thousands of those tickets are expected to be sold to fans that can't get into the arena itself, but no price has been set for them.\n\nPacquiao shows off his impressive speed - which he will hope will trouble Mayweather\n\nEarning an estimated $180million from the bout, Mayweather is confident he won't lose his perfect record\n\nKoncz said he talked to Pacquiao on Thursday about making sure he had enough tickets to take care of people in his camp. He said there have been requests from around the world for fight tickets, but that they have been forced to put them off because of the uncertainty over how many tickets are available and their pricing.\n\nOne thing that is certain, he said, is no one - including the celebrities who generally populate the ringside seats - is getting in for free.\n\n'Nobody's getting free tickets,' Koncz said. 'Even Bob (Arum) has to pay for his ticket in the first row.'\n\nMayweather and Pacquiao pose during a press conference ahead of their mega-fight in Las Vegas","Fans are in the dark ahead of Floyd Mayweather v Manny Pacquiao fight..

Not only does he shepherd nearly 1 billion Catholic souls, he also leads a small but morally significant state with envoys and interests in nearly every country.\n\nAs scholars like to say, the Vatican has walked the line between spiritual and worldly concerns for centuries. Sometimes, as when St. John Paul II stood up to Communist Poland, the church's moral and political clout have combined to pack a powerful punch. At other times, popes have to make a hard choice: Adopt the sharp tongue of a prophet or the discretion of a diplomat?\n\nThis Sunday in Rome, Pope Francis faced just such a dilemma.\n\nFirst, the back story:\n\nOne hundred years ago, more than 1 million Armenians (some estimates run as high as 1.5 million) died at the hand of the Turks. Many of the victims were part of a branch of Christianity closely aligned with Catholicism.\n\nA slew of  historians and at least 20 countries call the killings a ""genocide."" (A U.S. resolution to do the same has languished in Congress.) Turkish officials disagree, arguing that the deaths, while unfortunate, were part of a long-running war that witnessed casualties on all sides.\n\nFor their part, previous popes had finessed the genocide question.\n\nJohn Paul II used the ""g"" word in 2001, but didn't dare speak it out loud. Instead, it was tucked into a document signed by the former pontiff and the head of the Armenian church, after they had celebrated Mass together.\n\nPope Emeritus Benedict XVI called the killings ""a great evil"" and ""terrible persecution"" in a speech 2006, but avoided labeling them genocide. (Benedict found other ways to tick off the Turks, initially opposing their entry into the European Union.)\n\nAs Pope Francis prepared to celebrate a special Mass Sunday to commemorate a century since the slaughter,  Vatican watchers were divided about whether he would use the word ""genocide.""\n\nHe did, but in a roundabout way, by quoting John Paul's document.\n\n""In the past century, our human family has lived through three massive and unprecedented tragedies,"" Francis said. ""The first, which is widely considered 'the first genocide of the 20th century,' struck your own Armenian people.""\n\nThe middle phrase comes directly from the document issued 14 years ago by John Paul.\n\nIn citing his predecessor, Francis highlighted one of the Vatican's chiefest concerns, especially on matters of moral import: continuity. Whether holding the line against artificial birth control, declining to ordain female priests or dealing with diplomatic tensions, it sometimes seems as if the church considers inconsistency the most unforgivable of sins.\n\n""The Vatican and the papacy love continuity,"" said the Rev. Thomas Reese, a Vatican analyst for National Catholic Reporter.\n\nIf Francis had not called the Armenian killings a genocide, particularly at such a high-profile event -- the audience included Armenia's President -- it might have been interpreted as a change in church policy, Reese said.\n\nAt the same time, Francis didn't want to anger the Turks more than necessary, especially since they have become a key ally against the persecution of Christians by ISIS in the Middle East, which the Pope alluded to in his speech on Sunday.\n\n""The fact that he quoted John Paul is a sign that he's downplaying it,"" Reese said of the Armenian murders. ""He's telling people: There's nothing new here.""\n\nNew or not, Turkey was not happy.\n\nThe nation recalled its Vatican ambassador for ""consultations"" just hours after Francis' comments, the Turkish Foreign Ministry said. Turkey also promptly summoned his counterpart, the Vatican's ambassador, for a meeting, Turkish state broadcaster TRT reported.\n\nIn a tweet Sunday, Turkey's Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu called the Pope's use of the word ""unacceptable"" and ""out of touch with both historical facts and legal basis.""\n\n""Religious authorities are not places through which hatred and animosity are fueled by unfounded allegations,"" the tweet reads.\n\n""Hatred"" and ""animosity"" are not words often used to describe Pope Francis.\n\nBecause he often shines a sympathetic face on the world, emphasizing mercy over judgment, it's easy to miss the bluntness Francis brings to the bully pulpit. On matters of doctrine and diplomacy, he may be carrying on Catholic traditions, but in his willingness to engage in geopolitics and the tone that engagement often takes, this pope is decidedly different.\n\nHe has helped broker a backroom detente between the United States and Cuba, and invited Israeli and Palestinian leaders for an unprecedented prayer service at the Vatican (after annoying some Israelis with an impromptu prayer at the wall that separates the West Bank from Jerusalem.)\n\nBut Francis has also suggested that force may be justified to stop ISIS' slaughter of Christians, warned of the ""Mexicanization"" of Argentina and said that satirists who insult religion should expect a retaliatory punch.\n\nOn Monday, the Pope addressed a roomful of priests at morning Mass. He must have heard the hubbub about his ""genocide"" remark, but he encouraged his charges to speak frankly, without fear, and to bear the courage of their convictions, just as the early apostles had.\n\n""We cannot keep silent about what we have seen and heard,"" Francis said.\n\nCNN's Gul Tuysuz  and Jethro Mullen contributed to this report.","Previous popes had finessed the question of whether the killing of 1.5 million Armenians was genocide.. Because he often shines such a smiley face on the world, it can be easy to forget the bluntness Francis sometimes brings to the bully pulpit.","['“ Previous popes had finessed“ misleads, this is only Turks thought.\\n\\n“ 1.5 million” misleads, some say 1 million, some say 1.5 million\\n\\nMain issue not understood when naive\\n\\nImportant points of post (directly affects coverage and overall rating):\\nPope Francis mentioned “genocide” of Armenians (in a roundabout way), Turkish authority defend otherwise and not happy.', '•immediate/recent events not included\\n•summary is a bit incoherent.

Professional advice is particularly important in the face of the recent changes to pensions legislation and divorced retirees acting on advice received under the previous rules may want to consider seeking updated advice on any post-retirement plans they have made.\n\n'During a divorce the costs can quickly mount up, with legal fees, the cost of setting up a new home and the effect of splitting any existing retirement savings all potentially impacting the ability of those involved to continue saving into a pension. Unfortunately divorce is most likely among those aged 40 to 44, the period in many people's lives when earning potential peaks and the most valuable pension contributions can be made.'\n\nThe findings were based on a survey carried out by Research Pluse among 7,687 people aged over 45, who included 1,012 people intending to retire this year.","People who have never been divorced can expect an extra £2,100 a year..

Really- no big deal, if it's just a vaccination needle and he's a doctor. Do you really ""need"" control over over your own choices?'.\n\nThe Australian Vaccination Skeptics Network has come under fire for comparing vaccinations to rape\n\nThe image was posted in response to tough new laws announced by Social Services Minister Scott Morrison earlier in April, which means that parents will no longer be able to access childcare benefits simply by signing a form that says they object to immunisation based on 'personal, philosophical or religious' reasons.\n\nHowever, a president of the Australian Vaccination-skeptics Network said the message had nothing to do with the group. \n\n'I can state categorically that The Australian Vaccination-skeptics Network Inc does not support or agree with the sentiments or messages portrayed in the picture,' she said.\n\n'We do not own the page it was posted on.' \n\n'What the Australian Vaccination-skeptics Network does support and believe in, is the right of ALL parents to make an informed choice in regards to vaccinating their children, whether they vaccinate, selectively vaccinate or do not vaccinate at all,' she said.\n\n'We are pro-choice, pro-information and pro-parental rights. \n\nThe new federal law, which was in part prompted by the death of one-month-old Riley Hughes from complications arising from whooping cough, means that parents who refuse to immunise their children are set to lose up to $15,000 a year for every child when the changes come into force from January 1, 2016.\n\nThe post, which has since been removed, caused an instant outcry from followers and opponents of the group alike, with social media users labelling the post 'tasteless', 'disgusting', and a possible trigger for those who had suffered sexual assault.\n\n'Dear rape victims, according to the rabid anti-vaxxers what you went thru is no worse than. Shame,' said one social media user.\n\n'Are you saying that your child being immunised is as bad as your child being raped? This could also be very triggering for victims of sexual assault,' said another. \n\nThe administrator of the page defended the post, maintaining that is wasn't tasteless, but honest. \n\n'What truly is tasteless is our elected government trying to tell us that we have to vaccinate our children even if we don't believe it is best for their health,' the administrator wrote. \n\n'That is tasteless. And if you find this post confronting – imagine how you would feel if you were a parent who was being told that they were going to have to vaccinate their children or starve.'\n\nFiona McCormack, the CEO of Domestic Violence Victoria said the comparison was 'so irresponsible and inappropriate'. \n\nSocial media users labelling the post 'tasteless', 'disgusting', and a possible trigger for those who had suffered sexual assault\n\nThe image was posted in response to tough new 'no jab, no pay' laws which was announced by Social Services Minister Scott Morrison earlier in April\n\n'To compare a doctor injecting a child against something like the measles to rape … it's obscene,' Ms McCormack told The Age. \n\nOn Wednesday, a post to the page said that the controversial post was made by someone independent to the organisation.\n\n'As written in the about section, the AVN has not owned this Facebook page for some time. This page is open to the public. We sincerely apologise for an earlier post that caused offense to many, including supporters. We are still investigating and have taken your comments on board,' the post said.  \n\nThe Australian Vaccination Skeptics Network has previously used the metaphor of rape to oppose vaccinations, when reports of a child being given a court order to be immunised was labelled by the group as 'court ordered rape'.\n\n'Think this is an exaggeration? Think again. This is assault without consent and with full penetration too,' the post said. \n\n'If you were the doctor ordered to administer this vaccine and the mother was standing there, holding her child under a court order while you prepared the shot and she was begging you to stop and crying that it would hurt and you continued to do it anyway - how different is that from rape?' the administrator later commented on the post.\n\nThe Network has previously come under fire when it was stripped of its registered charity status last year. \n\nThe Australian Vaccination Skeptics Network has previously used the metaphor of rape to oppose vaccinations\n\n'Think this is an exaggeration?

It's the IVF Baby Club.' She also uploaded photographs of injecting herself for the first time as she began her IVF program.\n\nMel Greig spoke on her blog about how she was now starting IVF treatment \n\nShe posted photographs that showed her injecting herself for the first time as she began her IVF program\n\nThe radio host married her fiancé Steven Pollack at Byron Bay in November\n\nThe 33-year-old married her fiancé Steven Pollack at Byron Bay in a small and intimate ceremony on November 20. But the couple's efforts to have a baby have been thwarted because she suffers from Endometriosis. \n\nEndometriosis causes inflammation and can lead to female reproductive body parts and other organs fusing together, making it almost impossible for eggs to fertilise naturally, rendering many women infertile. \n\nMel was one of these women, and had been told she would not be able to fall pregnant naturally. It was then that she made the decision to have IVF treatment. \n\nSince then however, she has discovered that some women keep their IVF treatment a secret and are embarrassed about it. For this reason she took to her blog to highlight the issue. \n\nMel showed her support for women who were also going through IVF treatment\n\nThe couple's efforts to have a baby had been unsuccessful because she suffers from Endometriosis\n\n'When you are first told that news, you do feel like you've failed the process of being able to bring a child into the world as a ""normal"" mother,' she explained on her blog.\n\n'But my thoughts soon shifted to ""but I still have a chance to bring a child into this world and that's amazing"" we should NOT feel embarrassed to have IVF babies.'\n\nBefore Mel started her own treatment she said she understood why the majority of mothers wanted to keep quiet during the process of IVF as it was long, draining, intrusive, emotional, and for some parents, financially hard.\n\n'But when you are through the battle and are holding your precious baby, you should be happy and proud... don't feel embarrassed to say ""they were born through IVF"" you need to realise that science helped you with the end result,' she said on her blog.\n\nThe 33-year-old went public about it as she wanted to help remove the stigma that women can feel about having IVF treatment\n\nShe hit the headlines in December 2012 for her involvement in an infamous royal prank call\n\nWith fellow DJ, Michael Christian (right), they posed as the Queen and Prince Charles in  a phone prank that ended in tragedy \n\n'But it was YOU who decided to bring that child into this world, it was YOU (and partner/donor) who provided the magical ingredients to make your baby. \n\n'And it is YOU who is going to smother this child with unconditional love and support for the rest of their life and THAT is what truly makes you a ""normal"" mother.'\n\nMel has had to overcome challenges in her life before. In December 2012 she was hosting on 2 Day FM with fellow DJ Michael Christian when they posed as the Queen and Prince Charles, and rang the London hospital where the real life Duchess of Cambridge was suffering severe morning sickness with her first child.\n\nNurse Jacintha Saldanha who answered the phone and put the call through to the ward took her own life two days later and cited the distress at being fooled as one of the reasons.\n\nThe pair's call was answered by nurse Jacintha Saldanha who later committed suicide. She cited the stress caused by the prank as one of the reasons why she took her own life  \n\nHowever, after coming to terms with the tragedy and fallout from it, Mel is ready to take on the next challenge that life has thrown at her - the daunting prospect of IVF treatment.   \n\n'As I sit here loading up my first syringe I'm thinking, ""I hope I do this right. If my doctor doesn't answer which friend can I call to ask for advice?"" Women help each other, it's what we do,' she blogged.\n\n'But how can we do that if we don't know who to ask for help? Support networks are so important. I will share as much of this journey as I can, through the pain, heartache, joy... and I hope I don't feel the need to keep it private too.\n\nMel has had great support from her husband Steven (right) as she starts her IVF program  \n\n'If you are a part of this elite club and you know someone going through IVF, maybe take that first step and privately reach out letting them know you too have membership and you are there for them if they need someone.\n\n'I know that I'll be doing the same.'","Australian radio host stands up for Women going through IVF treatment..

But Tibetan Mastiffs are now so unpopular in China they are being sent to slaughterhouses – and their meat put into cheap hotpots.\n\nThe dogs' dramatic decline in fortune is being partly blamed on the Chinese government's wide-reaching anti-corruption crackdown.\n\nPreviously, wealthy businessmen would give the prized mastiffs to officials in the hope of influencing their decisions.\n\nLuo Yi, general manager of China's largest Tibetan Mastiff puppy farm, told People's Daily Online: 'The anti-corruption drive means people not daring to hand them out as gifts - nor would anyone take one as a gift.'\n\nIt is also thought recent bans on owning dogs of more than 50kg in several Chinese cities - including Beijing, Zhengzhou, Shanghai and Tianjin - has had a huge impact on the breed's popularity.\n\nTibetan Mastiffs – which were traditionally used in Tibet to herd other animals and are known for their loyalty - can weigh up to 80kg.\n\nChina's mastiff market collapse was revealed after animal-welfare workers rescued a group of the dogs that were being transported to a slaughterhouse.\n\nThe abattoir they were heading to provides hotpot meat for restaurants. The dogs' skin can also be used for leather belts.\n\nRescuers said they found the 20 mastiffs in cramped cages. A third of the dogs were already dead and none had been given food or water for three days. Several were suffering from broken bones.\n\nShocking trade: Twenty Tibetan mastiffs were recently found crammed into cages on their way to a slaughterhouse like the dogs in this picture - taken on a motorway in the Chinese capital Beijing in 2009\n\nIt is feared that across China hundreds of the dogs are meeting such a cruel fate.\n\nMastiffs are also being stolen from the streets by ruthless gangs, who sell them to the slaughterhouses, say animal charities.\n\nUnscrupulous breeders are also offloading their 'imperfect' specimens to the abattoirs.\n\nLuo Yi, whose puppy farm is in Tibet, said some of his fellow breeders had damaged the quality of the breed to make more money. 'Driven by profits there was a lot of cross-breeding which resulted in a deterioration of the Tibetan mastiff in terms of appearance as well as temperament,' he explained.\n\nThere was now a glut of poor-quality dogs that can't be sold, he added.\n\nLoyal: Tibetan mastiffs, like the one here, were originally used by people in Tibet to herd other animals\n\nIn their heyday: A visitor plays with one of the dogs at a Tibetan mastiff show in Shenyang city four years ago\n\nMeanwhile, Chen Youjun a specialist in Tibetan mastiff photography, said: 'The rapid pace of urbanisation across China has made more and more people now realise Tibetan mastiffs are not animals well-suited to city living.'\n\nThe breed's boom began in 2005 and led to the dogs being seen as status symbols. Just 13 months ago one puppy sold for £1.2million, which is thought to be the highest price ever paid for a dog.\n\nA property develop bought the golden-haired one-year-old from breeder Zhang Gengyun in the eastern province of Zhejiang.\n\nMr Zhang said of his dogs: 'They have lion's blood and are top-of-the-range mastiff studs.'\n\nMost expensive dog in the world: The gold-maned Tibetan mastiff pup (left) sold last year in east China for £1.2million.

The girl refused.\n\nIn January 2013, Khubaib picked up two friends - one aged 12 and the other aged 14 - in his seven-seater car and took them to a McDonald's, Mr Dennis said.\n\nThe girls became uncomfortable when Khubaib got into a row on his phone and slipped away.\n\nLater that month, the defendants were arrested at a terrace house in Peterborough, where police found two girls aged 14.\n\nKhubaib said in police interviews that his association with all of the girls was innocent and he had not acted in any improper way, denying any sexual contact with the girl he is said to have raped.\n\nMotaung also denied wrongdoing by saying he had consensual sex with the rape complainant.\n\nCambridgeshire Police and Peterborough City Council launched a 'victim-led' inquiry after identifying a number of young people who might have been at risk of sexual exploitation towards the end of 2012.\n\nThe joint investigation was proactively initiated in response to the Rotherham and Rochdale child abuse cases.\n\nNine Asian men from Rochdale, Greater Manchester, were jailed for a total of 77 years in May 2012 for raping and abusing up to 47 girls - some as young as 13 - after plying them with alcohol and luring them to takeaways.\n\nTwo years earlier, in November 2010, five men from Rotherham in South Yorkshire were jailed after being found guilty of grooming girls as young as 12.\n\nSeparately, a serious case review found last month that up to 373 children may have been targeted for sex by gangs of men in Oxfordshire in the last 16 years. \n\nWendi Ogle-Welbourn from the council said: 'What was different in Peterborough is that having followed other places like Rotherham and Oxford we knew we must have child sexual exploitation in our city.'\n\nThe two defendants, both from Peterborough, denied the charges. \n\nFollowing the verdict, Detective Superintendent Gary Ridgway, of Cambridgeshire Police, said: 'I'm pleased with the verdicts today because not only does it acknowledge the seriousness of this behaviour but also the courage of the young people who were able to face their abuser in court.'\n\nHe added that the investigation was more than two years old, and 'I do not underestimate the impact on some of the young people involved'.\n\nCambridgeshire Police and Peterborough City Council launched a 'victim-led' inquiry after identifying a number of young people who might have been at risk of sexual exploitation towards the end of 2012.\n\nThe joint investigation was proactively initiated in response to the Rotherham and Rochdale child abuse cases.\n\nA police spokesman said: 'We have made great efforts to safeguard these young people, win their confidence and explore what they told us. \n\n'As a result of the information given to us, we launched a number of investigations. A police investigation formally began in early January 2013.'\n\nA number of the victims were in care at the time and had problems at home and school while the abusers' ethnicity reflected the local demographic - Portuguese and eastern European, as well as Asian/Pakistani men.\n\nKhubaib's activities involved girls being befriended and then 'hooked' with alcohol in an attempt to make them 'compliant' to sexual advances\n\nA mother has spoken of her pride after her teenage daughter 'kick-started' the police investigation into Khubaib.\n\nThe teenager was targeted by him when she was just 14 in Peterborough.\n\nShe saw him three times, but grew scared when he had an argument over the phone after taking her to McDonald's and decided to tell her parents, who took her to the police.\n\nKhubaib, 43, did not touch her - but had a 'persistent and almost predatory interest' in teenage girls, the Old Bailey heard.\n\nThe girl's mother said the youngster found giving evidence at his trial 'worse than she expected' after her father broke down in tears when she went into the courtroom.\n\nShe said: 'We keep telling her how proud we are. At one point she got very depressed and kept saying ""I'm stupid, I'm silly"". But we told her that, at the end of the day, she has helped so many girls.\n\n'Luckily, nothing happened to her and she saw sense before it got any further - but she has helped so many girls and she should feel proud of that.\n\n'There are many girls out there, even though they don't know her, they are going to be thanking her.'\n\nThe woman said that the pressure of taking the matter to police had had a 'big impact' on her daughter.\n\nShe explained that before meeting Khubaib, the girl was an outgoing tomboy who enjoyed being out with her friends and going to school.\n\nShe said: 'After she told me and her father what had happened and we had gone to the police, she became a hermit.'","Married businessman Mohammed Khubaib convicted of raping girl, 14..

The colours are totally unsuitable for the older people that live here.\n\n'They should put up a sign saying ""Welcome to Legoland"".' \n\nThe residents' rent, of £103 a week plus bills, has remained the same since before the refurbishments took place. One neighbour, who lives opposite Redlands House and who did not wish to be named, described the building as an 'eyesore'.\n\nShe said: 'It would be great if it was for kids. If it was a nursery it would look lovely. It looked much better the way it was before they put the colour on it.'\n\nHowever Sue Barter, who lives on Redlands Avenue, said she was 'not indifferent to it'.\n\nShe said: 'I can see how residents might not like it. It's a shame it is not somewhere where more people can see it and appreciate it. But I wouldn't complain about it.'\n\nHayley Selway, head of housing for Vale of Glamorgan council said the aim of the refurbishment was to 'change the look and feel of the property and bring it into the 21st century'.\n\nMr White said after the colourful renovations that: 'They should put up a sign saying ""Welcome to Legoland"".'\n\nShe said: 'It is quite loud and vibrant. The design won't suit everyone's tastes and not everybody is going to like it.\n\n'This was about making a statement saying this is somewhere a little bit different.'\n\nShe said the vibrant colours, both internal and external, were chosen to help residents with low levels of dementia and those with sight problems. She said plans for the redevelopment were on display for residents before any construction began and no concerns were raised prior to the work starting.\n\nShe said: 'It is a matter of taste. Some residents rave about it. For others it is a huge departure from where they lived before but not everybody hates it.'\n\nNot impressed: Mr White stands outside the newly refurbished flats where he has lived for more than 3 years","Locals say the bizarre refurbishment is more suitable for a playground..

Two draws could see them go through so what was the problem? He said he didn't see Barcelona's slip on Saturday night against Sevilla because he was at the cinema 'enjoying a film' and when he was asked about Atletico Madrid's threat from set-pieces he responded: 'Don't forget we won the Champions League with a set-piece last season.'\n\nReal Madrid boss Carlo Ancelotti says he is not obsessed with Atletico Madrid ahead of Tuesday's clash\n\nMadrid-based papers Marca (left) and AS are looking ahead to the Champions League quarter-final first leg\n\nSergio Ramos (centre) scored an injury-time equaliser for Real as they beat Atletico 4-1 aet in the Champions League final last season at Benfica's Stadium of Light in Lisbon\n\nHowever, Atletico are unbeaten in six Madrid derbies this term and dumped Real out of the Copa del Rey\n\nHis reference to Sergio Ramos' injury-time goal against Atletico Madrid in Lisbon that levelled Diego Godin's header and allowed Real to run in riot in extra-time will have struck a chord with Real supporters who in the build-up to the game have been busy reminding their rivals that while they may have won none of the last six meetings they did come out on top in the match that mattered more than any other.\n\nReal Madrid are at full strength for the game and that seems to have left Ancelotti as upbeat and confident as at any time so far this season. He toyed with his Spanish inquisitors when they questioned him about whether or not Gareth Bale would start the game. The Welshman was rested at the weekend but will be in the XI on Tuesday night.\n\n'If Bale is not 100 percent fit he will not play because we have everyone available' said Ancelotti leaving a pregnant pause. But as the possibility that Spanish favourite Isco might start the game presented itself the Italian coach added: 'But he is 100 percent.'\n\nHe added: 'Bale was fantastic last season but had been really good this season. He came good in the big finals scoring in the Champions League and Copa del Rey finals so let's see how he performs now in the final months of the season.' \n\nGareth Bale (centre) is set to start for Real after being rested at the weekend against Eibar on Saturday\n\nLike Ramos, Bale was also on target during Real's Champions League final success over Atletico last season\n\nThe feeling among Real Madrid's coaching staff is that while Bale has been criticised by the Madrid press for not being the team player that Isco is, his ability to win a big final with a goal or an assist is unmatchable.\n\nAnelotti added: 'I am not obsessed with Atletico Madrid,' mentioning 'attitude' several times in his positive discourse and admitting that was the key missing ingredient from Real Madrid's 4-0 defeat to Atletico in February. He said facing Simeone was 'honour and a problem' and picked out Atletico Madrid's resilience when asked what their greatest quality was. 'They fight from the first minute to the last,' he said.\n\nAtletico Madrid fans believe that fight will see them overcome Real Madrid for the seventh time this season and the Vicente Calderon will be full for what, with their title hopes now gone, is their game of the season.\n\nReal's swagger has been rediscovered though, wth the return of key players Sergio Ramos, James Rodriguez and Luka Modric.\n\nAncelotti recalled the moment Modric' corner was headed in by Ramos in Lisbon.

Heller, said.\n\n'I take the responsibility and obligation of being a parent very seriously.'\n\nIn a full statement to UsWeekly Loeb added: 'Where a man does want to become a father, and wants to impose no obligations on the other party, he should have that corresponding right.' \n\nLoeb is a a scion of the Loeb and Lehman families and his father ran the prestigious Wall Street investment firm Loeb, Rhoades & Co. before becoming US Ambassador to Denmark and a delegate to the United Nations.  \n\nLoeb and Vergara created the embryos through in vitro fertilization in November 2013 and they remain frozen at a Beverly Hills clinic.\n\nIn a full statement released to UsWeekly Nick said: 'I have always strongly believed that life begins at fertilization and that every embryo is a life on the journey towards birth.

I have previously offered to waive any parental or financial responsibilities or obligations on the part of my ex, and to even give her the opportunity to be involved with the child in the future, should she change her mind. I take the responsibility and obligation of being a parent very seriously. Creating an embryo in the natural way can lead to parenthood obligations, even where a man doesn't want to become a father.

He then calmly picks up the mango and holds it up to the crowd.\n\nLater in the evening, the president mentioned the incident in one of his customary live TV broadcasts and displayed the infamous mango as proof.\n\n""Marleni Olivo,"" Maduro said. ""We're going to invite her to my [TV and radio] show, 'In Touch with Maduro.' She had a housing problem, right? And, Marleni, I have approved it already, as part of the Great Housing Mission of Venezuela, you will get an apartment and it will be given to you in the next few hours. Tomorrow, no later than the day after tomorrow, we will give it to you.""\n\nMaduro also joked that he had something in common with the mango. The word ""maduro"" in Spanish means ripe.\n\nOlivo told local media her intention was to toss the president a note, as others in the crowd were doing.\n\n""I didn't have paper available at that moment,"" she told El Pitazo TV. ""What I had was a mango that I was about to eat because I was hungry.""\n\nMaduro's critics are calling the incident a ""manguicidio,"" a play on the words ""mango"" and ""magnicidio,"" a Spanish word meaning assassination of a powerful leader. In Venezuela's extremely polarized political climate, Maduro frequently talks about his belief that the opposition is conspiring to target him for assassination.\n\nBut the mango-thrower says she had no evil intent.\n\n""My dream is to own a home before I die,"" she told El Pitazo TV, adding that she had been very ill recently, that she suffers from diabetes and hypertension.\n\nAnd now her dream is about come true, a dream that would not have been possible without her boldness and a little help from a tasty mango.","Marleni Olivo, 54, hit Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro in the head with a mango..

Booker Jr. of Topeka, an American citizen also known as Mohammed Abdullah Hassan, was taken into custody near Manhattan, Kansas, in a van that contained what he thought was a bomb, the criminal complaint said.\n\nThe ""bomb"" had actually been put together by two confidential informants with nonexplosive materials, the complaint said. Fort Riley's security was never breached and no people were in danger, the U.S. Justice Department said in a press release.\n\nBooker enlisted in the Army last year and was due to ship out to basic training April 7, 2014, said Army spokesman Wayne Hall. The criminal complaint said the FBI questioned him March 24, 2014 about comments posted on Facebook, such as, ""Getting ready to be killed in jihad is a HUGE adrenaline rush. I am so nervous. NOT because I'm scare to die but I am eager to meet my lord.""\n\nBooker waived his Miranda rights and told the agents he enlisted to commit an insider attack against American soldiers like Maj. Nidal Hassan had done at Fort Hood, Texas, the complaint said. Hassan opened fire in a building in November 2009, killing 13 people and wounding more than 30.\n\nHis enlistment was terminated March 24, 2014, at the request of Army Criminal Investigation Command, Hall said.\n\nBooker began communicating with a confidential informant later in 2014, the complaint said, and often talked about his plans to engage in violent jihad in support of ISIS. He and the informant watched ISIS videos together, the complaint said, and Booker talked about how he wanted to go to Iraq and turn his weapon on American soldiers when ordered to shoot the enemy.\n\nOn March 9, Booker said he believed ISIS wanted him to commit a truck bombing in the United States and thought a good target would be nearby Fort Riley, a large Army base that's home to the 1st Infantry Division, known as ""The Big Red One.""\n\nBooker said ""that detonating a suicide bomb is his No. 1 aspiration because he couldn't be captured, all evidence would be destroyed and he would be guaranteed to hit his target,""  the criminal complaint said.\n\nHe made a video with a Fort Riley airfield in the background and said ISIS was coming to kill American soldiers, both abroad and in the United States, the complaint said.\n\nBooker acquired components for a bomb and rented a storage locker to store the components, the complaint said. The plan was for confidential informants to build a bomb and for Booker to drive to Fort Riley and detonate it, the complaint said. But the bomb was built with ""inert"" parts and would never explode, the complaint said.\n\nOn Friday, the informants and Booker drove to what Booker thought was a little-used utility gate near Fort Riley, the complaint said. While Booker was making final connections on the ""bomb,"" the FBI arrested him, the complaint said.\n\nHe was charged with one count of attempting to use a weapon of mass destruction, one count of attempting to damage property by means of an explosive and one count of attempting to provide material support to the Islamic State of Iraq, a designated foreign terrorist organization.\n\nIf convicted, he could face life in prison.\n\nAlexander E. Blair, 28, of Topeka was taken into custody Friday and charged with failing to report a felony.\n\nThe FBI said agents interviewed Blair after Booker's arrest. Blair said he shared some of Booker's views, knew of his plans to detonate a vehicle bomb at Fort Riley and loaned him money to rent storage space, according to the FBI's criminal complaint. He said he thought Booker would carry out his plan but did not contact authorities, the complaint said.\n\nIf convicted, Blair faces a maximum of three years in prison.","Alexander Blair, 28, of Topeka accused of knowing about bomb plot but not contacting authorities..

for example, the remake of Poldark starring Aidan Turner attracted 6.9million viewers for its first episode, less than half the number who tuned in to the original series 40 years ago.\n\nWhile other programmes such as Eastenders and Strictly Come Dancing remain popular, primetime audiences are still much smaller than the highs they reached before the advent of the internet.\n\nMatthew Postgate was appointed the BBC's chief technology officer on a salary of £225,000 - more than the Prime Minister - in July last year.\n\nHe was previously head of BBC research and development, working on digital projects including high-definition internet broadcasts.\n\nMr Postgate was also involved with developing the BBC iPlayer, and was at one point in charge of the corporation's mobile services.\n\nHe was educated at Bristol University, and worked as a telecommunications consultant before joining the BBC in 2003.\n\nMr Postgate was appointed last year on a salary of £225,000 to pick up the pieces after the failure of the £100million Digital Media Initiative, which was scrapped by director-general Tony Hall.\n\nThe strategy was designed to streamline all the BBC's online services and give its staff access to the corporation's whole archive at once, but it collapsed in 2013.\n\nTechnology chief John Linwood was sacked over the fiasco, but last year he successfully sued the BBC for unfair dismissal. \n\nMr Postgate told the FT: 'Rather than trying to deliver one large project, we've been taking off the different components and moving forward.'\n\nLast year it was announced that BBC Three, the youth-oriented digital TV channel, will be taken off the air and become internet-only.\n\nThe move could herald a new wave of services moving to the internet - but Mr Postgate insisted that other channels will remain on broadcast TV for the time being, saying: 'BBC Three was a brand that you could move from one platform to another relatively easily.'\n\nMr Postgate also predicted that more and more BBC services will be consumed via mobile phones and tablet computers rather than on traditional channels.\n\nHe wrote in a blog post last night: 'We will increasingly use the internet to deliver programmes and services to you in the future - whether that's to the big screen in the living room or the smartphones and tablets scattered over the house.'\n\nRadio 1, which is also aimed primarily at young people, has expanded its online offerings via sites such as YouTube - controller Ben Cooper said last month that it was 'no longer a music station' but a 'multi-platform youth music brand'.\n\nFuture: The BBC has increasingly been promoting its services on digital platforms such as iPlayer\n\nFigures released in November showed that children spend half as much time as adults watching ordinary broadcast TV, but much more time watching online video.\n\nIf the trend continues, the television licence fee could be under threat as viewers opt out of the £145.50 payment and watch online instead.\n\nIt is thought that around 500,000 people take advantage of the so-called 'iPlayer loophole', but that figure is likely to rise if more BBC services become online-only.\n\nMPs recently called for the licence fee to be amended so that viewers who only use catch-up services will have to pay it.\n\nMr Postgate said in a statement today: 'I'm not talking about the BBC only putting its content online. My role is to make sure that the BBC's technologies that underpin everything we do - from our newsroom infrastructure and new in-the-field production and editing tools, to how we keep the BBC on air and online - are set up in the best possible way, and take advantage of new internet-based technologies.'\n\nWhen the Digital Media Initiative (DMI) was launched in 2008, it was hailed by BBC chiefs as 'the single most important initiative we are working on'.\n\nBut before a year had elapsed, it was floundering so badly insiders referred to it as 'Don't Mention It.'\n\nThe BBC originally appointed IT firm Siemens to implement the scheme. But it ditched the company in 2009 as the project floundered and took it back in-house.\n\nBy then, £26million had already been wasted but it is understood the BBC later recouped the cost from Siemens.\n\nIn February 2011, the National Audit Office condemned the corporation over its handling of the DMI after it ran 21 months behind schedule.\n\nThe public spending watchdog found the expected gains had been overstated and the difficulty of delivering it was underestimated.\n\nThe Public Accounts Committee criticised the BBC for awarding the contract to Siemens without putting it out to open tender.\n\nThe project was meant to allow production staff to access all video and audio material on their computers.\n\nAs hundreds of staff moved to the corporation's new headquarters in Salford, this would prevent them having to transport tapes of archive material by road from London, reducing production costs.\n\nBut the costs of the project continued to spiral to £98.4million until it was finally halted in May 2013.",BBC is aiming to compete with internet services which have captured younger generation of viewers..

She initially had surgery to remove tumours from her neck that September and she then underwent a course of radiation treatment to 'mop up' the cancer in December.\n\nBut when a return visit to the doctors revealed cancer cells had spread to other parts of her body, Ms Fox rejected further conventional medical treatment in favour of a diet and lifestyle plan she discovered online. \n\nScroll down for video  \n\nAs a model, Candice Marie-Fox (right) rubbed shoulders with the likes of last year's Bachelor Blake Garvey\n\nJuice in hand: Candice-Marie Fox (pictured) claims to have cured her cancer with a nutritional program involving the heavy consumption of pineapples \n\nMs Fox underwent surgery and radiation treatment. She is planning to release relevant medical records without her personal details\n\n'I was feeling a bit lost, just winging it on the internet myself,' she said, until she discovered a U.S. organisation called the Nutritional Oncology Research Institute.\n\nShe would sometimes spend weeks on a fruit-only diet, taking up yoga and leaving her stressful job behind to join a positive-thinking dance group called The Liberators International. \n\nHer diet program involved her drinking 'morning juice', dipping into boxes of pineapples each hour and taking vitamins. \n\nMs Fox said when she returned to the doctors months after embracing her new lifestyle, medical staff found her cancer had been radically reduced in size and is now gone. \n\n'I have got rid of it all (the cancer) 100 per cent myself through just hardcore nutrition, loving myself and meditating, adopting all stuff I thought never would have worked,' she said. \n\nBloggers have questioned that assertion, demanding medical evidence for her claims and questioning her understanding of her radiation treatment. \n\n'I am merely requesting that you are transparent about something as serious as being able to cure cancer using nutritional means,' one wrote.\n\n'The truth is not negative or mean or bullying in any way whatsoever.' \n\nIn response, Ms Fox said she was applying to obtain all her relevant medical records, which will take 45 to 60 days to obtain. She is planning release them in a PDF file, without personal details such as her Medicare number and contact details.\n\nMs Fox also said she is seeking a trusted independent investigator to examine her claims and insisted she is not promoting her cause for fame or money.\n\n'I didn't even know about this Belle Gibson lady,' she said. 'I don't know whether she did have cancer or what.'\n\nMs Fox (pictured) has been questioned by bloggers over claims she cured her cancer through a diet as well as meditation \n\nAs part of the modelling world, Ms Fox is friends with The Bachelor Blake Garvey\n\n'I didn't even know about this Belle Gibson lady,' she said. 'I don't know whether she did have cancer or what.'\n\n'All I know is, she's not me, I'm not her. \n\n'My story is so far removed from anybody else's story because it's mine. \n\n'It's unique, and it's exactly how it happened. 'So why am I not allowed to share that? \n\n'Why am I not allowed to help people heal? I'm not making money out of this, I'm not trying to hurt anyone.'\n\n'I'm not a fraud and I'm not a fake'. \n\nMs Fox said she 'totally understood' that people were sceptical and that people were concerned her message could discourage people from seeking conventional treatments - but that wasn't her agenda. \n\n'It just seems they've got this massive agenda to break down my story. \n\n'I know I can sleep at night and in my heart I am doing what I know to be right.'\n\n'I haven't changed anything, I haven't deleted anything. \n\n'It really did change the way I f***ing lived'.\n\nCancer Council nutritionist Kathy Chapman said maintaining a healthy diet is 'one of the things you can do to support your treatment', but dismissed 'magic diets' as unproven.  \n\n'I think it's really important for anybody who is facing cancer that they put their faith in medical doctors who are going to be backed up by sound research,' Ms Chapman said. \n\n'A lot of the people claiming these cures with special magic diets you need to ask - where's the scientific studies there to back them up, and they are missing in this case.'\n\nOncologist Dr Ian Olver, the director of the Samsom Institute, said there was evidence a diet of fresh fruit and vegetables with less red meat could prevent cancer. \n\nBut Dr Olver, from the University of South Australia, said there was little evidence to suggest food could cure cancer and that he was concerned about the popularity of so-called 'wellness warriors'. \n\n'People may be lured into abandoning or not taking up potentially curative treatments because something's become popular for which there is no evidence. \n\n'Even if someone claimed they were cured by a certain diet, you'd like to know if that happened one in two (cases) or one in 20000 - but these anecdotes get blown up into suggestions for lifestyle.'  \n\nCandice (pictured left) would sometimes spend weeks on a fruit-only diet, taking up yoga and leaving her stressful job behind to join a positive-thinking dance group called The Liberators International.","Perth woman claimed she cured cancer through her pineapple-centric diet..

Newcomb was fired in 2013 for failing to meet training requirements, according to the department.\n\nCharged: (From left to right) Charles Thomas Newcomb, Thomas Jordan Driver, and David Elliot Moran each were arrested Thursday on one state count of conspiracy to commit murder, Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi's office said\n\nBondi's office said the three were also members of the Traditionalist American Knights of the Ku Klux Klan. The group has garnered attention in recent months for distributing flyers that likened protesters in Ferguson, Missouri, to terrorists.\n\nThe FBI was initially alerted to the murder plot by a confidential informant inside the Klan, according to an arrest affidavit. \n\nThe FBI's affidavit described the informant as 'a confidential human source for the FBI whose motivation for cooperation with the FBI is patriotism.' The informant was present when Driver and Moran talked with Newcomb, identified as the KKK chapter's 'Exalted Cyclops' or leader, and recorded many of their conversations.\n\nIn late 2014, authorities say Driver provided the Klan chapter, called a klavern, with a photograph of the inmate, who'd been let out on supervised release.\n\n'Both Driver and Moran ... told the (confidential informant) that they wanted (the inmate) ""six feet under,""' the FBI's affidavit said.\n\nThe informant recorded all three men making plans to murder the inmate - ranging from shooting him to injecting with a lethal dose of insulin, which Newcomb said 'would be quieter.' In the recordings, the men often refer to the man using a racial epithet. \n\nThe affidavit said the informant, Moran and Newcomb went on a trip together to where the inmate lives in Palatka. \n\nBefore they made the trip, 'Newcomb pointed out that if they could grab (the inmate) and take him to the river, he would need to bring a fishing pole to make it look like (the inmate) was at the river fishing,' the affidavit said.\n\n'Newcomb told (the informant) he wanted to make it as realistic as possible, but if they had to go in there blazin, they would do what they had to do,' the affidavit continued. \n\nTheir first attempt to find and kill the inmate failed. \n\n'The FBI pre-arranged to have a law enforcement presence in the area of (the inmate's) residence to prevent a crime being committed that day,' the affidavit said. 'A vehicle with police lights was staged on the same street a block away from (the inmate's) residence and a police patrol vehicle aggressively roved the neighborhood to establish an active law enforcement response.'\n\nThe informant later recorded a conversation with Driver to confirm he still wanted him dead.\n\n'Okay, but do you want this guy terminated?' the informant asked.\n\n'I think for this individual...I think a message isn't going to do him any good,' Driver replied, according to the affidavit.\n\n'Okay so I take that as a yes?' the informant said.\n\n'Yes sir,' Driver said, according to the affidavit.\n\nIn March, the FBI gave the informant a burner cellphone with a doctored photograph that appeared to show the inmate had been fatally shot. The informant showed all three men the photograph and recorded their jubilant reactions.\n\n'According to (the informant), Newcomb smiled upon seeing the photograph that depicted that (the inmate) had been shot and killed,' the affidavit said. \n\nMoran, whom the men referred to as 'Sarge,' was smiling when he saw the photograph that depicted the inmate had been murdered, according to the informant.\n\n'Moran also gave (the informant) an enthusiastic handshake upon seeing the photograph,' according to the affidavit. \n\n'Driver smiled, nodded his head in a yes motion and shook the (informant's) hand in gratitude,' according to the affidavit.\n\nBondi said and corrections department officials were quick to condemn the suspects' alleged actions, but the incident highlights an ongoing stream of high-profile problems in Florida's prison system.\n\nLast fall, prison system officials fired nearly 50 employees, including several over allegations that they punched and beat inmates.\n\nThe deaths of inmates Randall Jordan-Aparo and Darren Rainey also drew attention.\n\nJordan-Aparo was reportedly gassed while in a confinement cell at the Franklin Correctional Institution.\n\nRainey, a mentally ill prisoner, was punished in 2012 with a shower so hot that his skin separated from his body at Dade Correctional Institution. The warden there was fired.\n\nReaching out: The American Knights of the Ku Klux Klan has garnered attention for distributing flyers that likened protesters in Ferguson, Missouri, to terrorists. A recent flyer from the Klan provided by WTXL-TV is seen here\n\nIncident: The state said the murder plotting started after Driver, an officer at the Department of Corrections Reception and Medical Center (pictured) in rural north Florida, had a fight with the inmate\n\nDepartment of Corrections Secretary Julie Jones, who was hired late last year to lead the troubled agency, called the arrests 'disquieting.'\n\n'We are moving swiftly to terminate the employees arrested today and working closely with Office of the Attorney General to assist in their prosecution,' she said in a written statement.\n\n'Our Department has zero tolerance for racism or prejudice of any kind. The actions of these individuals are unacceptable and do not, in any way, represent the thousands of good, hardworking honorable correctional officers employed at the Department of Corrections.'\n\nThe case will be prosecuted in Columbia County in north Florida.\n\nDriver and Moran are being held in Union County jail. Newcomb is in Alachua County Jail with bond set at $750,000.\n\nFrank Ancona, imperial wizard of the KKK group to which the three men were said to belong, did not confirm or deny their membership.\n\n'We at the TAK do not in any way condone, tolerate, or support any type of illegal activity in our organization and because of this we would stand by any of our members pending a decision by a court of law, not a decision of the court of media or public opinion,' Ancona said.","Thomas Driver, David Moran, and Charles Newcomb each were arrested  on one state count of conspiracy to commit murder..

Here stands one of the most magnificent of the cemeteries, the Helles Memorial to the British.\n\nTroops are remembered in row upon row of immaculate Commonwealth war graves and huge expanses of dazzling white marble, etched with the names of the fallen, which circle the cemetery.\n\nAccompanied by a feral dog and her puppies, we strolled down the dirt track to V Beach cemetery where the sea laps below the walls and where two Irish battalions were laid to rest. \n\nThe mighty ruined fortress of Seddülbahir, brought to its knees by Allied naval firepower in 1915, overlooks the cemetery.\n\nThe ruins of the fortress at Seddülbahir in Gallipoli - its name in Turkish means 'barrier to the sea'\n\nSeaside homes dot the flat sands and yellow sandstone bluffs rise out of the Aegean. In the valleys between the cliffs, olive and tamaris trees grow down the steep escarpments. \n\nWe stopped for a stiff coffee at a modest coffee house on the square, opposite the mosque at Sedd al Bahr, and watched the fishermen's tiny rowing boats bobbing in the slack waters of Cape Helles.\n\nA far cry from the fateful morning of April 25 1915, when one of the bloodiest and most ill-conceived campaigns of the First World War kicked off, a campaign which almost brought to an end the career of its main instigator, Winston Churchill, and which witnessed almost 400,000 casualties.\n\nThe Allied plan was as brilliantly simple in conception as it was hopeless in execution: secure the Straits and take Constantinople, giving access to the Black Sea to supply the Russians in order to free up a new line of attack on the Germans. \n\nIt would also pull in the Greeks and Bulgarians, ancient enemies of the Ottoman Turks, and hey presto, the stalemate of the Western Front would be suddenly transformed into a glorious victory from the East.\n\nChurchill, who was First Lord of the Admiralty, had underestimated the strength of the Turkish troops, under the command of modern Turkey's founding father, Kemal Atatürk, and had overestimated the potency of his own superannuated fleet, which fell easy prey to the mines and coastal gun batteries. \n\nChurchill (left) had been a soldier, but in 1916 underestimated the Turkish  forces led by Atatürk (right)\n\nIf the naval thrust was a failure, his attempt to consolidate on land was a calamity, and after nine months of blistering summer heat and frostbitten winter nights the ragbag army of dysentery-ridden men was evacuated the following December and January, and Churchill was forced to resign his post.\n\nThe easiest way to access the peninsula is from the port of Canakkale, which is a quick ferry ride across the narrowest section of the Straits. \n\nThe Gallipoli War Museum (Canakkale Destani Tanitim Merkezi), is well hidden from view but well worth finding. \n\nThis 5,600 square metre visitor centre, on the road to Kabatepe, was commissioned by the army and the Ministry of Defence and was only recently finished. \n\nIt is an architectural triumph that does justice to its subject.\n\nThe Gallipoli War Museum has many relics from the campaign from both the Allies and Turkish sides\n\nIn addition to 11 rooms, with cinema screens shockingly simulating what it was like in the trenches of Gallipoli.\n\nThere are also some rather more prosaic offerings which carry poignant memento mori: bullets with bullet holes in them as well as Atatürk's waistcoat and dress shoes.\n\nThere are also letters, watches, mangled boots and water canteens that would be inadequate for a summer school trip to Longleat safari park.\n\nItems of clothing worn in battle by Mustafa Kemal Atatürk who commanded the Turkish forces at Gallipoli\n\nThe battle sites and 31 memorials to the 130,000 dead covers a surprisingly small area. This is because Allied troops were unable to make much headway against the ferocious onslaught of Atatürk's men. \n\nHeat, exhaustion, illness and difficult terrain also dogged every step. \n\nWith an impressive flourish of national pride, the Turkish government has declared the whole area a Historic Park, to show the futility of war. \n\nUp at Chunuk Bair, where the Allies enjoyed a shortlived victory, the trenches have been preserved. \n\nYou can look down on Suvla Bay 540m below, where British troops landed, and walk a few hundred metres along the preserved dug-outs in the footsteps of New Zealand's Wellington Battalion, before visiting the New Zealand monument. \n\nHere, a statue to Atatürk, the Allies' nemesis, celebrates the moment when a fob watch covering his heart prevented a bullet from possibly changing the course of modern history.\n\nFrom the Australian monument at Lone Pine there are views across the peninsula, from the Aegean to the Dardanelles. \n\nNearby is Kiliçbayiri, the memorial to the Turkish 57th Infantry Regiment, which was wiped out following the Allied landings at Anzac. \n\nAtatürk, the 19th Division commander, famously told his men: ""I am not ordering you to attack. I am ordering you to die. During the time before we die other forces and commanders will take our place."" \n\nThe great man, of course, lived to tell the tale.\n\nBefore taking the 10-minute ferry back across the Straits to Canakkale we walked through the French Memorial at Morto Bay. \n\nLined by rosemary bushes, baytrees and well-ordered flowerbeds, this is perhaps the biggest and most atmospheric of them all, with 3,236 graves and four ossuaries containing the bones of 12,000 unidentifiable soldiers.\n\nIt surprises many to learn that more French soldiers were killed at Gallipoli than Australians and New Zealanders combined. \n\nMark Porter was a guest of the Turkish Culture and Tourism Office. For more information on Turkish holiday, visit www.gototurkey.co.uk \n\nTurkish Airlines flies form the UK to various Turkish destinations.\n\nHotel Tusan organises trips to the battlefields.\n\nSuch a pity that so few French visit. \n\nWe returned to the Hotel Tusan, near Canakkale, haunted by a hellish vision of the past made all the more poignant by the tranquillity which pervades the present.\n\nWhile the 100th anniversary itself is going to be a tad too busy for most, the museum and Historic Park are open to all 365-days a year. \n\nFor those unable to make the celebrations on the day, there is always a fallback position: Russell Crowe's film about it, The Water Diviner, is out now","25 April is the centenary of the  ill-fated Gallipoli invasion by Allied troops..

Deputies in DeKalb, in the Atlanta area, tracked down Kennedy and arrested him on a charge of sexual assault by multiple perpetrators, the Bay County Sheriff's Office said.\n\nKennedy is from Murfreesboro, Tennessee, and has been a student at Middle Tennessee State University, the sheriff's office said.\n\nPreviously, Ryan Calhoun and Delonte Martistee were arrested and charged with sexual battery by multiple perpetrators, the sheriff's office said. Calhoun was released Saturday after posting $50,000 bond; Martistee remains in Bay County Jail, a county deputy said.\n\nTroy University in Alabama said the two are students and have been ""placed on temporary suspension from school per the university's standards of conduct and disciplinary procedures. Martistee, a member of the track and field team, has also been removed from the team.""\n\nMartistee is represented by a public defender. Calhoun's legal representation is unclear. No public statement has been made on either's behalf.\n\nThe arrests come after a woman told police she may have been drugged and gang-raped on a beach behind a popular club in broad daylight as bystanders watched.\n\nThe woman didn't recall the assault, police say, but she saw the video of her alleged assault on the news, and though the footage had to be blurred, she recognized her tattoos and contacted authorities.\n\nIt's not the first time this has happened to a young woman in Panama City Beach, authorities say.\n\nFour young men were involved in the assault, Bay County Sheriff Frank McKeithen said, and while he previously said federal marshals were trying to track down a third suspect and investigators were seeking a possible witness, it's unclear if the person arrested Tuesday was someone the police had been looking for.\n\n""There's hundreds, hundreds of people standing there -- watching, looking, seeing, hearing what's going on,"" McKeithen said. ""And yet our culture and our society and our young people have got to the point where obviously this is acceptable somewhere. I will tell you it is not acceptable in Bay County.""\n\nAuthorities have said they plan to interview the woman and show her the full video to see whether she knows the attackers and can help identify other suspects, said Ruth Corley, spokeswoman for the sheriff's office.\n\nAuthorities are pressing charges, and the woman plans to cooperate, Corley said. Investigators were to meet with her this week.\n\nAfter interviewing witnesses, Bay County investigators determined the alleged rape took place between March 10 and March 12, behind Spinnaker Beach Club, a popular bar and dance club for spring breakers.\n\nShe ""does not remember the assault at all,"" Corley said. ""She remembers taking a drink from a CamelBak and there is a strong possibility she was drugged."" (CamelBak sells various products for transporting water or other drinks.)\n\nShe was visiting Panama City Beach at the time of the assault, and is now home, authorities said.\n\nThe Troy, Alabama, Police Department found the video during the course of an investigation into an unrelated shooting and turned it over to the Bay County Sheriff's Office.\n\nThe video shows suspects pushing the victim's hand aside and holding her legs down, Corley said. ""You can see in the video there are people two feet away. They were assaulting her, and we believe the people around her knew she was being assaulted.""\n\nThe suspects can be heard commenting about what they are doing to her, Corley said.\n\nAuthorities have three sworn statements from witnesses stating that the assault happened, Corley said.\n\nThe sheriff's office released part of the video to local TV stations, which blurred portions of it before airing. CNN is showing part of what was released.\n\nWhile the video is ""one of the most disgusting, repulsive, sickening things that I've seen this year on Panama City Beach,"" it's not an isolated incident, McKeithen said.\n\n""This is not the first video we've recovered. It's not the second video. It's not the third video. There's a number of videos we've recovered with things similar to this, and I can only imagine how many things we haven't recovered.""\n\nCorley said that through social media, ""we have been able to find video of girls, incoherent and passed out, and almost like they are drugged, being assaulted on the beaches of Panama City in front of a bunch of people standing around.""\n\nAbout 100,000 spring break revelers come to the beach community every year. This year, the Bay County Sheriff's Office made more than 1,000 arrests for various crimes -- about triple the number of arrests made in the same period last year.\n\nCNN's AnneClaire Stapleton, Josh Levs and Alexandra Field contributed to this report.","Third suspect identified as George Davon Kennedy of Murfreesboro, Tennessee..

But about 20,000 people died from execution, starvation or exhaustion during this exodus at gunpoint, according to war crimes prosecutors; the others were subjected to slave labor in rural camps once they reached their destination, where many met similar fates.\n\nThe urban evacuation marked the first phase in the Khmer Rouge's revolutionary program of social engineering, intended to establish a new order -- free of money, family ties, religion, education, property and foreign influence.\n\nAimed at creating an agrarian utopia, it would instead prove one of the worst genocides of the modern era, resulting in the deaths of at least 1.7 million Cambodians -- about a quarter of the country's population -- over the next four years.\n\nLy remained in the capital with her father and four other siblings, three of whom would succumb to starvation and disease in the following years, before her father was shot to death before her eyes in 1979.\n\nHis killing prompted Ly to leave her sole remaining family member, youngest sister Bo, in the care of a local couple. She set out on her own, making her way to a refugee camp and eventually to the United States.\n\nFor more than 30 years she has wondered what happened to her baby sister.\n\n""I think she was the only family member to survive,"" she says, with tears in her eyes.\n\nAs she finishes her story, the producers usher a woman on the stage. It's Bo.\n\nLy embraces her sister and both women sob.\n\n""I missed you so much,"" Ly says.\n\n""I've always searched for you,"" Bo tells her.\n\nSince production began five years ago, the television show, ""It's Not A Dream,"" has reunited members of 54 Cambodian families shattered by the genocide. More than 1,500 have sought its help.\n\nThe series is just one example of the ways in which Cambodia's traumatized society is beginning to undertake the fraught, painful business of reckoning with their history.\n\n""The scars of the Khmer Rouge are very deep and physical and present in modern Cambodia,"" said Theary Seng, a human rights lawyer whose parents were killed by the regime, and who moved to the U.S. as a refugee before returning to her homeland as an adult.\n\nShe described the country as a ""land of orphans.""\n\nFor decades after the Khmer Rouge were driven from Phnom Penh by Soviet-backed Vietnamese forces in January 1979, the regime's crimes were seldom spoken about, let alone attempts made to seek redress for victims.\n\nIn large part, this was because people remained scared, say experts.\n\nFar from being snuffed out by the Vietnamese invasion, the Khmer Rouge existed for another two decades.\n\nAfter fleeing the capital in 1979, Khmer Rouge leader Pol Pot and his supporters established a stronghold in the west.\n\nThey continued as an insurgent guerrilla force and became part of a government-in-exile that, until 1990, was recognized by the U.N. as the country's only legitimate representative.\n\n""In many villages, people have been living side by side with the executioners for decades,"" said Krisna Uk, executive director of the Center for Khmer Studies.\n\nCraig Etcheson, a Cambodia expert at the School for Conflict Analysis and Resolution at George Mason University, said that ""for many years, there was a virtual taboo on even speaking of the Khmer Rouge, as if the very words were ... a malevolent spirit lurking in the corner of every room.""\n\nThe silence was also due to the fact that Cambodians, in Seng's words, ""lacked the vocabulary"" of therapy and healing to process a crime of the magnitude of the one perpetrated against their society.\n\nThe Khmer Rouge's attempts to reboot society at ""Year Zero"" had involved a concentrated effort to exterminate the country's educated classes -- doctors, lawyers, accountants, engineers, merchants and clergy.\n\n""Nearly two generations of young Cambodian men grew up learning little more than how to kill,"" said Etcheson. ""When it was finally time to rebuild, there were effectively no bootstraps with which the country could pull itself up again.""\n\nEven today, said Uk, young Cambodians are not taught about the genocide in high school.\n\nIn an impoverished country -- one of Asia's poorest, albeit with 7% predicted economic growth this year -- most young people seemed to be focused on getting ahead than looking back, she said.\n\nSome were even skeptical that the Khmer Rouge's crimes -- the systematic butchery of the ""killing fields"" -- had really occurred, she added.\n\nThe space for discussing, redressing and healing from the genocide only began to open up in the past decade with the establishment of the Khmer Rouge Tribunal, said Seng.\n\nFounded in 2006, the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia (ECCC) is a ""hybrid"" tribunal using both Cambodian and international judges and staff to investigate the Khmer Rouge's crimes against humanity and bring leading regime figures to justice.\n\nIntended as a southeast Asian equivalent of the Nuremberg trials, the tribunal, which has cost $232 million so far, initially enjoyed broad support.\n\n""We had great hope for this process,"" said Seng. ""The presence of the international community raised the comfort level of the population to speak about the Khmer Rouge crimes.""\n\nBut the pace of proceedings has seemed glacial, given the advancing years of the suspected war criminals, two of whom have died while facing trial. Another was ruled mentally unfit to stand trial. (The Khmer Rouge's top leader, Pol Pot, died in 1998, having never faced charges.)\n\nThis, coupled with persistent accusations of political interference from the Cambodian government, has soured attitudes towards the court.\n\nSeng, who once appeared as a civil party in proceedings, today regards it as a ""sham."" For many victims, it is ""too little, too late.""\n\nOPINION: An ongoing struggle for justice after the Khmer Rouge\n\nIn the first case heard, Kaing Guek Eav, also known as Comrade Duch -- commandant of the notorious Tuol Sleng prison where more than 14,000 people were killed -- received a life sentence for war crimes, crimes against humanity, murder and torture.\n\nThe court's only other verdicts, delivered in August last year, sentenced Non Chea, the regime's ""Brother Number Two,"" and Khieu Samphan, ""Brother Number Four,"" to life. Both men have appealed their convictions.\n\nIn a separate case, the pair are on trial on additional charges of crimes against humanity and genocide. Evidence is expected to continue being heard into 2016, ECCC spokesman Lars Olsen said.\n\nTwo further, and highly controversial cases, known as 003 and 004, are also currently under investigation.\n\nThree people were charged last month in relation to those cases: former Khmer Rouge navy commander Meas Muth; Im Chaem, a former district commander accused of leading a labor camp; and Ao An, a former deputy accused of overseeing massacres at detention centers. Two other suspects are being investigated.\n\nOlsen said no further cases would be pursued after 003 and 004.\n\nPrime Minister Hun Sen, Cambodia's strongman leader for decades, has long been a vocal opponent of 003 and 004, claiming that pursuing the cases could push the country towards civil war.\n\nHun Sen himself is a former Khmer Rouge battalion commander, who defected to the Vietnamese side; his perceived political interference is viewed by critics like Seng as an attempt to shield political allies from the tribunal.\n\nOthers are more forgiving of the tribunal's shortcomings.\n\nEtcheson, a former investigator for the tribunal, has described it as an ""imperfect vessel"" for delivering justice, but says Cambodia's leaders must strike a balance between two imperatives: delivering justice for victims, and completing the reintegration of former Khmer Rouge into society.\n\nHe said the most important aspects of the tribunal's work are those that take place outside the courtroom -- triggering changes in Cambodian society.\n\n""In that respect, the proceedings ... may be shaping up to be more successful than anyone could have hoped,"" he added.\n\nUndoubtedly, Cambodians today have overcome the fear of talking about the genocide -- to the extent that even the perpetrators feel emboldened to say their piece.\n\nKrisna Uk said the country has seen a wave of Khmer Rouge memoirs, written by former cadres wanting to argue their case before they die.\n\n""There's a lot of people who want to tell the world they've been fooled by a grand idea of a revolution which went bad,"" she said.\n\nKhieu Samphan, ""Brother Number Four,"" published one such effort ahead of his trial, while Sikoeun Suong, a Sorbonne-educated former diplomat for the Khmer Rouge regime, published his ""Journey of a Khmer Rouge Intellectual"" in French in 2013.\n\nHe told an interviewer from France's Le Monde last year that he believed that Khmer Rouge dictator Pol Pot's prescriptions for Cambodia were sound.\n\n""I remain convinced that the Marxist analysis made by Pol Pot of the socioeconomic situation of Cambodia, a poor and sparsely populated country, was correct,"" he said.\n\nFor survivors, these self-serving justifications for crimes gone unpunished must be hard to take.\n\nBut for a few of them, at least, Cambodia's opening up about the genocide has finally brought about the prospect of some healing, however bittersweet.\n\nOn the stage of the ""It's Not a Dream"" studio, as Ly hugs her long-lost sister, footage of an even older woman is projected on a screen.\n\n""Do you know the person in the video?"" the show's host asks.\n\n""Yes,"" Ly says. ""She is my mother.""\n\nMoments later, Te Souymoy, 77, is brought up on stage.\n\n""Where have you two been?"" Te asks. ""I always worried about you two.""\n\n""I thought you died,"" Ly says.\n\nThe three women cry and embrace.\n\n""It is very miserable for all of us,"" the old woman says.","Phnom Penh, the Cambodian capital, fell to the genocidal Khmer Rouge 40 years ago today.. At least 1.7 million people were killed in the subsequent Four years, before the regime was driven out.. Decades on, the country is still struggling to gain justice For victims and heal from the genocide.","['summary could be improved by mentioning Ly, or the show ""It\'s Not A Dream""', 'The summary is generally accurate and covers some of the key points, although its formatting and flow makes it harder to read']",0.4492179357890205,0.21821519595359185,0.38068352710336767,0.0403179102849639,0.5110828492423658,0.5394952233930065,0.38748542899996546,1.0,0.36357486567152,0.0,0.8542652339702269,0.5118660544102579,0.5582924641629052,0.6023197702811132,0.036193434531090196,0.02837653739740978,0.6780348835786588,0.09047982553415154,0.0751488893794112,0.6030287526859714,0.05049775979530913,0.04205893049179103,0.6395995276277351

She is pictured with daughter Araya, now nine months\n\nShe found a pea-sized lump, which hospital tests revealed was cancerous.\n\nShe began six months of chemotherapy, followed by radiotherapy and surgery and is now in remission.\n\nShe says her implants saved her life, because as she didn't regularly check for lumps, without knocking her breast she might not have discovered the tumour until it was too late.\n\nIt was after breastfeeding her first baby Brayden, who is now 12, that Mrs Davies first decided she wanted a boob job.\n\n'I was left with saggy breasts after feeding,' she said. 'There was just no tissue left, so I decided to get implants to restore my confidence.\n\n'I thought they would improve how I felt about myself. I didn't know they would save my life too.'\n\nMrs Davies, a semi-permanent makeup technician, said she was happy with her new breasts after having the procedure, and settled down to life as a new mother.\n\nShe went on to have her daughter, Macy-Rayn, in 2010.  \n\nBut, three years ago she was sorting through some laundry when she caught her breast on the door frame.\n\nBreast cancer is the most common type of cancer in the UK.\n\nIn 2011, just under 50,000 women were diagnosed with invasive breast cancer. \n\nMost women who get it (8 out of 10) are over 50, but younger women, and in rare cases, men, can also get breast cancer. \n\nMost breast lumps aren't cancerous, but it's always best to have them checked by a doctor. \n\nA person should  see a GP if they notice any of the following symptoms:\n\n* an area of thickened tissue\n\n* nipple discharge, which may contain blood\n\n* a change in the size or shape of your breasts\n\n* dimpling on the skin of your breasts\n\n* a rash on or around your nipples\n\n* a change in your nipple's appearance – for example, becoming sunken into your breast\n\n* persistent pain in your breasts or armpits\n\n* a lump or swelling in your armpits\n\nSource: NHS Choices \n\nRubbing the sore area, she felt a pea-sized lump and her husband Tristan, 36, urged her to visit her GP.\n\nMrs Davies said: 'I was only 30 and didn't think it would be anything to worry about.\n\n'I just went to put my mind at ease.\n\n'The doctor referred me to hospital for further tests. I was told it was very unlikely to be anything sinister, but they wanted to be cautious.'\n\nA few weeks later doctors advised her to have a lumpectomy test, and this confirmed she had cancer, which is extremely unusual in someone her age.\n\nWhile breast cancer is the most common type of cancer in the UK, 8 out of ten women who get it are over 50 years old. \n\nMrs Davies describes the pure terror of being given such a diagnosis.\n\nShe said: 'I was devastated. I just kept crying thinking I was going to die and imagining my children growing up without me.'\n\nThat July, she began six months of chemotherapy and radiotherapy, but the cancer had spread to the lymph nodes surrounding her breast.\n\nShe then had an operation to remove five lymph nodes containing cancerous cells, and afterwards doctors were confident she was in remission. \n\nHowever, they said the treatment would probably leave her unable to have more children.\n\nShe explained: 'Afterwards, they told me they'd got all the cancer but that I wouldn't have anymore children as a result of the treatment.\n\n'I would have liked more, but I was already lucky enough to have one of each and was just so happy to be alive.\n\n'All thanks to my boob job.'\n\nMrs Davies only went to her GP about the lump she had found because husband Tristan, 36 (pictured here with her on their wedding day) begged her to go\n\nMrs Davies says her implants saved her life and will allow her to see her children, including her youngest baby Araya (pictured) grow up. Now, she urges all women to check their breasts for lumps\n\nHowever, she soon suspected she might be pregnant and took a test, which revealed she was, in fact expecting. \n\nHer daughter Araya-Maye, is now nine months old, sister to Brayden, 12 and Macy-Rayn, five.\n\nShe describes Araya-Maye as her 'second miracle'.\n\n'The first is discovering the lump. It was less than a centimetre in size, so if I hadn't knocked my breast, I would never have felt it.'\n\n'Who knows what would have happened? I never checked my breasts. I wouldn't in a million years have thought it was necessary at my age.\n\n'I thought breast cancer was something that affected older women.\n\n'Having implants was a confidence thing. I wanted to be able to wear a bikini and feel good about myself.\n\n'But if they'd stayed the same size I would never have knocked them.\n\n'My implants saved my life. I'd ask all women – however young – to check their breasts.'\n\nOne in five women later diagnosed with breast cancer had originally put off making a GP appointment for at least four weeks\n\nThousands of women are risking their lives by waiting more than a month before seeing their GP after spotting breast cancer symptoms.\n\nOne in five diagnosed with the disease had put off making an appointment for at least four weeks, allowing the cancer time to spread and potentially reducing their chance of survival.\n\nAnd one in 20 had delayed seeing the doctor for more than six months, according to a survey of patients.\n\nSome said they were scared about what they might be told, while others were worried they would be seen as a nuisance.\n\nWomen in their fifties and sixties were among the worst culprits, the poll by the charity Breast Cancer Care found, because they wrongly assumed they were in the clear after they had been through menopause.\n\nBritain has one of the worst cancer survival rates in Europe and this has been blamed on the disease being detected too late.\n\nBreast cancer patients in the UK have a five-year survival rate of 81 per cent, lagging behind many European countries, with France, Italy and Sweden boasting an 83 per cent survival rate back in the mid-1990s.","Leza Davies had a boob job as her chest sagged after Breast feeding..

They converted lips into petals in two orchid species by reducing the activity of the L complex using gene silencing (illustrated)\n\nConversion of lips into sepal/petal-like structures in Oncidium and Phalaenopsis orchids is shown\n\nOrchids have three sepals, which sometimes look like other petals, and a single column at the centre.\n\nLips attract insect pollinators and serve as a landing platform for them, which is thought to have given orchids an evolutionary advantage over other flowers, by promoting reproduction.\n\nTo discover why the flowers developed their distinctive lips, researchers  from National Chung Hsing University in Taiwan studied the expression of a class of genes known to be associated with petal development.\n\nThey found that in mature orchid flowers, the expression pattern suggests two protein complexes, called the 'L' complex and the 'SP' complex, compete to promote the formation of the lip and standard petals.\n\nThe have called this mechanism the Perianth code and discovered that orchid species from many subfamilies with different types of lips and petals all obey it.\n\nThe experts were also able to convert lips into petals in two orchid species by reducing the activity of the L complex using gene silencing.\n\nLips attract insect pollinators and serve as a landing platform for them, which is thought to have given orchids an evolutionary advantage over other flowers, by promoting reproduction. \n\nLips are differently coloured, ruffled or pouch-shaped, depending on the species, and can be decorated with horns, hairs, warts, teeth and tails to attract specific pollinators.\n\nThese range from bees to flies, gnats, moths, butterflies, hummingbirds and even bats in some tropical climates.\n\nTo discover why the flowers developed their distinctive lips, Chang-Hsien Yang and his colleagues from National Chung Hsing University in Taiwan studied the expression of a class of genes known to be associated with petal development.\n\nThey found that in mature orchid flowers, the expression pattern suggests two protein complexes, called the 'L' complex and the 'SP' complex, compete to promote the formation of the lip and standard petals.\n\nThe have called this mechanism the Perianth code and discovered that orchid species from many subfamilies with different types of lips and petals all obey it.\n\nThe experts were also able to convert lips into petals in two orchid species by reducing the activity of the L complex using gene silencing.\n\nThe scientists studied the expression of a class of genes known to be associated with petal development. They found that in mature orchid flowers,  two protein complexes, called the 'L' complex (red) and the 'SP' complex (blue), compete to form the lip and petals. This competition and balancing act is illustrated above\n\nThe pastel-coloured orchid mantis has fascinated naturalists for more than a century.\n\nIt was popularly thought that the insect, whose legs are flattened and heart-shaped to resemble petals, simply mimics an orchid, allowing it to 'hide' and catch prey.\n\nBut earlier this year, scientists suggested that the mantis doesn't simply blend into flowers, but is attractive to insects in its own right, sometimes preferring to remain more easily visible on leaves.\n\nIt was popularly thought that the orchid mantis (pictured), whose legs are flattened and heart-shaped to resemble petals, simply mimics an orchid, allowing it to 'hide' and catch prey\n\nDr James O'Hanlon of Macquarie University, Australia, set about systematically testing the ideas contained within the traditional view of the orchid mantis' modus operandi.\n\nFirst, his team tested whether mantises actually camouflage among flowers, or, alternatively, attract insects on their own.\n\nFor a flower-seeking insect, as predicted, the mantis' colour pattern is indistinguishable from most common flowers.\n\nHowever, when paired alongside the most common flower in their habitat, insects approached mantises more often than flowers, showing that mantises are attractive to insects by themselves, rather than simply camouflaging among the flora.\n\n'We can clearly observe insects, like bees, diverging from their flight paths and flying right towards this deceptive predator,' Dr O'Hanlon said.\n\nWhen paired alongside the most common flower in their habitat, insects approached mantises more often than flowers, showing that mantises are attractive to insects by themselves, rather than simply camouflaging among the flora. Here, an orchid mantis eats a Tiger heliconian butterfly in Malaysia\n\nThey also found that mantises did not choose to hide among the flowers, but selected leaves to sit on, just as often.\n\nSitting near flowers did bring benefits, though, because insects were attracted to the general vicinity.\n\nWhen they compared the mantis's shape and colour with flowers from an insect's perspective, the predator did not resemble an orchid or indeed any particular species of flower, but rather a 'generalised' flower.\n\nThey may exploit a loophole created by evolutionary efficiency savings within the insect brain.\n\nThe compact brains of insects use a rule of thumb - anything matching colour X is a nectar-containing flower – and the predator uses 'sensory exploitation' to catch its victims.\n\nSensory exploitation is a concentrated mass of the right colour. The insect classifies the mantis as a giant nectar-filled flower and approaches to investigate – to its doom.","Orchid has evolved a 'lip' - irregular modified petal - to attract insects ..

We go to the park a couple of times every year but this is the first time something like this has happened.\n\n'It was on the third day of a five day trip in the morning that we saw the buffalo. We were on the h3 road, going from the from Malelane satellite camp  towards Skukuza camp.\n\n'It started when we saw two male lions just past abridge heading towards a waterhole.\n\n'They got a drink of water and then slept under bushes on our left hand side and then we spotted the buffalo on our right side. \n\n'The wind was in the lions favour, they jumped up in unison and walked fast over the road towards the buffalo.They looked really hungry and needed food, that's when the action started.\n\n'The lions stalked the buffalo before one jumped on its back. That lion held on for almost 30 minutes until the buffalo ran towards the cars. It's horn punctured a car wheel which gave the lion a fright.\n\n'The other male lion got thrown through the air but came back and also started biting the buffalo by its tail. We could smell the blood.  \n\nLife or death: Miss Odendaal, a teacher from the village of Lothair, captured these images of the beasts fighting with one-another before the buffalo crashed into her vehicle\n\nExplain that to the insurers! A fully grown buffalo can weigh up to 1,750lbs - about half the weight of a VW Golf - and stands six foot tall, meaning it left quite a dent in the car's door\n\n'Just before the lions could bring the buffalo down it punctured the car wheel and then ran into our car taking the mirror off.\n\n'I was in the car with my sister and her two children, one-year-old Hendri, and Lisa who is four.\n\n'The children started crying after the buffalo hit the car but we told them to sit really still.\n\n'I hoped that the lions would manage to bring the buffalo down in order to feed. They need to eat as well but other people were screaming for the poor buffalo. \n\n'I gained even more respect for lions watching this with my own eyes the perseverance it takes to try and bring it down and the buffalo really hurt them running through the bush with them.'\n\nShe also revealed that the unlucky buffalo caused around £11,000 worth of damage to the car. \n\nNadav Ossendryver, the founder of Latest Sightings, a website that tracks animals in the Kruger park, uploaded the pictures last week and said it was something he'd never seen before.\n\nMs Odendaal's friends also joked about the close-shave on Facebook, with Jeremy Hallett quipping: 'Explain that to your insurance!'\n\nThe Kruger National Park spans 7,500 square miles of territory in the north east of South Africa along its border with Mozambique, making it one of the largest game reserves in Africa.\n\nOne of a kind: When Miss Odendaal's images were uploaded to website for spotting wildlife in the Kruger park, it's founder said he had never seen anything like it before\n\nThe park is home to more 12,000 elephants, 1,000 leopards, 2,800 lions, and 27,000 African Buffalo, with the climate ranging from savanna scrubland in the south, to tropical in the north.\n\nThe buffalo that call the park home can reach heights of six foot and weigh around 1,750lbs - or around half the weight of a VW Golf.\n\nThe male African lion, pictured here, reaches an adult weight of just under 500lbs, making it the second largest big cat after the tiger, but still nowhere near as large as the buffalo.","Rone Odendaal, 24, took pictures of two lions hunting an elderly Buffalo..

As a result, the bag became known as the Kelly and has been hugely popular ever since.\n\nVictoria Beckham and Kim Kardashian are big fans of Hermes ... handbag Victoria reportedly owns a collection worth £1.5m\n\nThe Birkin has similarly romantic roots, conceived as it was in honour of French star Jane Birkin.\n\nThe Birkin was allegedly created after the company's CEO Jean Louis Dumas sat next to the actress on a Paris to London flight.\n\nBirkin had been discussing her difficulty in finding a leather weekend bag, explaining her ideal.\n\nShortly after, in 1984, the bag she described arrived at her flat with a note from Dumas. Although nowadays the bag can be made to order, the design is still one of the most recognised in the fashion industry.\n\nAnd Victoria Beckham isn't the only celebrity Birkin fan.\n\nBritish-born author Barbara Taylor Bradford owns an impressive 24 and heiress Tamara Ecclestone has specially built cupboards to house her £100,000 collection.\n\nKatie Holmes, Julia Roberts, Hilary Duff and Kelly Brook are also fans while Jane Birkin, the inspiration behind the roomy leather must-have has said she covers her 'b***** heavy' Birkin with stickers to disguise the fact she's carrying a 'snobbish' bag.",Rare tote is so exclusive that it can't even be brought in store..

It is believed Gray fell head-first into the back of the van, breaking his neck, during the journey\n\nInside: The above diagram shows the inside the police van\n\nPictured: The second stop which police failed to report in their paperwork after the van journey, during which Freddie Gray sustained a 'catastrophic' head injury. It was picked up by a privately-owned security camera\n\nAccording to the latest police press conference, these are the stops the van made transporting Freddie Gray \n\nThe news comes hours after Baltimore Police admitted the van transporting Gray made a previously unreported stop.\n\nThe mysterious detail was picked up by a privately-owned security camera, and will be integral to the police investigation into Gray's death, which was completed and handed to the state prosecutor on Thursday morning.\n\nIt is not known why the van stopped at the corner of North Fremont Ave and Mosher Street before it made another two stops then finally transported Gray to the hospital. \n\nAnd police have yet to clarify why Gray would have been standing without a seat belt on. Just nine days before his arrest, the Baltimore Police Department issued a new policy, making it obligatory to belt all inmates placed in the back of a transport van. \n\nRevelation: Police Commissioner Anthony Batts revealed a private security camera captured the van making an unknown stop. He refused to elaborate on the details of the new information\n\nPolice Commissioner Anthony Batts refused to elaborate on the new information.  \n\nHe said the contents of the report, which was completed and handed to the State Attorney at 8.50am Thursday, will remain confidential as they continue to investigate.\n\nSix officers have been suspended with pay over the incident, and the department has admitted Gray - who was asthmatic - should have been given the medical help he requested. \n\nThe report that Gray fell inside the van corroborates claims he was given a 'rough ride' by the van driver, who is the only officer yet to deliver a statement to the investigators, according to ABC.\n\nThe van in which Gray was injured is a Chevrolet Express - the same model of vehicle which has been modified into the 'Scooby' van driven by Hillary Clinton. \n\nAs the police department, Mayor's office, and state prosecutors refuse to address the development, it has done nothing but fuel anger and speculation surrounding the circumstances of Gray's arrest more than two weeks ago.\n\nA relative of one of the suspended police officers told CNN she believes Gray was injured during his arrest outside the van. Her family member, she said, was based inside the van, and she fears he will be made a scapegoat for something he 'didn't do'.\n\nHowever, this theory is at odds with the medical examiner's report which allegedly found Gray sustained injuries by falling over inside the van, where he had been placed without a seat belt. \n\nThe woman, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, told CNN her family member was in the van with Gray as he screamed and cried for medical help.\n\nBut she believes the spinal injury which led to Gray's death was inflicted earlier, during his arrest on April 12.\n\nIn an appeal that echoes Gray's family, she is calling for the police department to conduct a thorough investigation that will determine which of the six suspended police officers dealt the fatal blow.\n\n'Six officers did not injure this man,' she told Don Lemon.\n\nSecret stop: This is the corner where the police van was spotted making a previously unreported stop\n\nThese are the security cameras outside a grocery which picked up the secret stop\n\nJung Hwang's convenience store's camera footage revealed a new stop the police van made while transporting Freddie Gray\n\n'Six officers didn't put him in the hospital.\n\n'I'm worried that instead of them figuring out who did, that six officers are going to be punished behind something that maybe one or two or even three officers may have done to Freddie Gray.' \n\nHer words came after a police document was leaked to the Washington Post, in which the other prisoner in the transport van with Gray said he could hear the 25-year-old slamming himself against the wall. \n\nThe prisoner speculated that Gray was trying to hurt himself. \n\nIn the documents, the unidentified prisoner says he was loaded into a police van after Gray on April 12, and apparently told investigators that he heard Gray 'banging against the walls' and 'intentionally trying to injure himself'.\n\nHowever, he admits he could not see what Gray was doing, since they were separated by a metal partition. The statement was cited in a warrant to search an arresting officer's clothing for possible traces of Gray's DNA. \n\nThe van in which Gray was injured is a Chevrolet Express - the same model of vehicle which has been modified into the 'Scooby' van driven by Hillary Clinton\n\nThe assertion that Gray may have caused his own death in the back of the police van was quickly rejected by an attorney hired by his family.\n\n'We disagree with any implication that Freddie Gray severed his own spinal cord,' attorney Jason Downs told the Post. 'We question the accuracy of the police reports we've seen thus far, including the police report that says Mr Gray was arrested without force or incident.' \n\nOutrage over the unexplained death of a black man in Baltimore, Maryland prompted nationwide protests against police brutality on Wednesday from Houston to Boston.\n\nBaltimore has been the scene of near-nightly protests ever since the April 19 death of 25-year-old Freddie Gray, who is believed to have been fatally injured while in police custody. \n\nState Attorney Marilyn Mosby urged the public to be patient as she reviews the information.\n\n'While we have and will continue to leverage the information received by the department, we are not relying solely on their findings but rather the facts that we have gathered and verified,' Mosby said on Thursday. \n\n'We ask for the public to remain patient and peaceful and to trust the process of the justice system.' \n\nFreddie Gray: The 25-year-old was poisoned by lead paint as a child growing up in Baltimore\n\nFreddie Gray was a 25-year-old African-American who grew up in Baltimore's impoverished west side\n\nNicknamed 'Pepper', he was described by an ex-girlfriend as happy-go-lucky with an infectious sense of humor.\n\nThe Baltimore police knew him, however, as a 5ft-8ins felon who had notched up at least 18 arrests and a handful of convictions - mainly for Class A drugs but also burglary, assault and illegal gambling.\n\nHe was said to have set off running at the sight of police patrolling a well known open-air drug market.\n\nHe was taken into custody for possession of a switchblade and during transport to the station he experienced what officers described as 'a medical emergency'.\n\nGray, who had asthma, requested an inhaler and had trouble breathing in the van, but police didn't provide his inhaler.\n\nAccording to Gray's family his spine was severed 80 per cent at his neck, three vertebrae were fractured and his larynx was injured.\n\nCourt papers describe Gray's childhood as problematic. He lived with his heroin-addicted disabled mother in a home in Sandtown-Winchester that contained enough poisonous lead in the peeling painted walls and windowsills for a court settlement to conclude that he and his two sisters were incapable of leading normal functioning lives.\n\nLab tests conducted in the 1990s showed that they had levels of lead in their blood nearly double what the state of Maryland defines as the minimum for lead poisoning.\n\nIn Baltimore, more than 2,600 children have been found to have high levels of lead in their blood, according an annual report released by the Maryland Department of the Environment in 2014.\n\n'This is the toxic legacy of lead-based paint,"" Ruth Ann Norton, head of the Green & Healthy Homes Initiative and a founding member of the Maryland Lead Poisoning Prevention Commission, told the Baltimore Sun.\n\n'Our kids are ill equipped to stay in the classroom, finish school. They're very unlikely to go on to higher education. They're less likely to be able to hold a job', she said.\n\n'They're less equipped to be able to overcome the poverty and other circumstances that pull them down. Children with lead poisoning will have defects, regardless of whether their parents are 'nice' or not.'\n\nGray lived off the resulting 'lead check' settlement although it is unclear exactly how much he received.\n\nWhatever money he did have he was said to spend buying designer accessories.\n\nThe Sandtown neighborhood is a 72-block neighborhood made up of almost entirely of African Americans.\n\nMore than one-third of residents live below the poverty line, and nearly a quarter are unemployed.\n\nThe majority of Maryland's state prison population are said to said to hail from Sandtown, according to the Justice Policy Institute.","Medical examiner 'found Freddie Gray's catastrophic head injury was consistent with bolt in the back door of the Police van' Police report suggests he was standing and fell head first into the door..

She said that the plane did not land because of just one person's medical emergency as a lot of people on board began to feel dizzy and unwell \n\nPassenger Frank Angelo said he immediately feared for the safety of his wife and kids as the plane 'nosedived' 30,000 feet in just eight minutes\n\n'You could feel something in the air, something just wasn't right,' recalled one passenger before the plane plunged miles in mere minutes. Passenger Larry Johnson, right, said: 'A lot of people with their heads down praying. It just felt like a re-enactment'\n\nEmergency nurse, Mary Cunningham, said she helped treat an unconscious passenger when another passed out beside her and others nearby started feeling faint.\n\n'The flight attendant and myself started not feeling very well while we were in the middle of the flight helping out. I had to sit down. I was short-of-breath, light-headed [and] didn't feel great,' said Cunningham to NBC Connecticut.\n\nInitially, reports came in that a cabin door had opened during the flight, leading to dramatic loss in cabin pressure. \n\nWhen the plane landed at 11.40am, the FAA issued a statement saying the crew 'reported a pressurization problem and declared an emergency', shortly before landing in Buffalo.\n\nHowever, in a second statement the FAA put out on Wednesday afternoon, there was no mention of a 'pressurization' issue.\n\nWhen contacted by the LA Times to explain this, a spokesperson for the FAA would not say why the change was made.\n\nHowever, an official with knowledge of the incident told the LA Times that crew members did report that a door had come open at 38,000 feet and was causing 'rapid depressurization.'\n\nOn landing this was declared untrue and SkyWest airlines said they were examining what happened on the aircraft midflight.\n\nSkyWest spokeswoman Marissa Snow said: 'There were no reports before the unconscious passenger prior to the initiated descent, but I can't speak to what may have been the specific cause of their feeling ill.'\n\nSkyWest added that there was no indication of any problems with the doors and that its mechanics were inspecting the aircraft.\n\nNose dive: Emergency vehicles surround a SkyWest Airlines plane, operating as United Express, that made an emergency landing at Buffalo Niagara International Airport on Wednesday\n\nFlight 5622, from Chicago to Hartford, made an emergency landing in Buffalo\n\nPassenger, Dave Barkley, 46, told the LA Times that he was sat near the front of the aircraft and he saw a flight attendant race to the cockpit and tell the pilot passengers were falling unconscious.\n\nSuddenly, the pilot announced the plane was going to begin an emergency landing over Detroit.\n\n'They said there was a pressure problem with the plane,' he said. 'There was no door flying open or anything like that. It was something very gradual.'\n\nBarkley said that while the passengers were calm, he was annoyed about with public statements the airline has made.\n\n'The way SkyWest is reporting it is that someone got sick, and they had to land,' he told the LA Times. 'But the way we understand it, they got sick because of the lack of oxygen or lack of pressure in the plane.' \n\nA nurse flying on the Embraer 175 twin-jet described a growing sense of panic and hysteria as she herself began to feel ill while treating two women who had passed out.\n\nIt was at that moment the pilot took decisive action and put the plane into a steep dive rather than take any risks. \n\n'The passenger was lethargic. She was responding but her color was off. She didn't look good. We got her some oxygen. She was much more alert after getting the oxygen,' the nurse, Mary Cunningham, tells NBC Connecticut. \n\nCunningham says she returned to her seat once the woman felt better. It was then when she says the woman sitting behind the first passed out, as well.\n\nThen Cunningham, herself, took a turn.\n\nPassengers arriving at Buffalo Niagara International Airport react to the group of media gathered to report on a SkyWest Airlines plane that made an emergency landing after one passenger aboard Flight 5622 lost consciousness and the pilots rapidly descended 'out of an abundance of caution.'\n\nCourtesy WKBW  \n\n'The flight attendant and myself started not feeling very well while we were in the middle of the flight helping out. I had to sit down. I was short-of-breath, light-headed [and] didn't feel great.' \n\nPassenger Larry Johnson said, 'A lot of people with their heads down praying. It just felt like a re-enactment.'\n\nWhile another passenger said, 'you could just feel something in the air, something just wasn't quite right.'\n\nFor nearly eight minutes, the plane descended at a very steep incline, dropping as fast as 7,000 feet per minute, while flying over Lake Erie, flight tracking service FlightAware said. \n\nThe flight originated in Chicago and had been bound for Bradley International Airport in Windsor Locks, Connecticut. It landed at Buffalo Niagara International Airport in Buffalo at about 11:40 a.m. \n\nSkyWest Inc., which is based in St. George, Utah, said the jet landed safely and a passenger received medical attention before being released.\n\nAn additional 15 adults and two children were evaluated upon landing, but none required treatment outside the airport, airport spokesman C. Douglas Hartmayer said.\n\n'Anyone who said they didn't feel well was treated at the gate,' he said. \n\n'We want to understand the circumstances and what SkyWest knows before we decide what, if any, action we would take,' said Kelly Nantel, spokeswoman for the National Transportation Safety Board. \n\nSnow said the plane's oxygen masks did not release. \n\nAccording to WKBW, one passenger said the plane 'nosedived' and crew told fliers that there was a loss of cabin pressure, but that turned out not to be true. \n\nSkyWest has 29 Embraer 175s in its fleet. The aircraft seats 76 passengers with two flight attendants. \n\nIn a statement, the FAA said: 'SkyWest Airlines Flight 5622, an Embraer E170 aircraft, landed safely at Buffalo International Airport at 11.40am after the crew declared an emergency.  \n\n'The FAA will investigate.'\n\nThe Skywest flight made an emergency landing at Buffalo Airport (pictured) on its journey from Chicago O'Hare to Bradley International Airport in Connecticut","Skywest Inc, based in St. george, Utah, said the jet landed safely and three passengers received medical attention before being released ..

But, a professional to his core, Benaud kept on filing. He loved cricket, and he loved conveying his love, by visual means or verbal.\n\nThat much was evident during his playing days. He won 63 Test caps between January 1952 and February 1964, collecting 248 wickets with his leg-spin (at a very good average of 27) and scoring 2,201 runs at 24. But it was the style as much as the stats.\n\nIt was often an understated era, typified by Jim Laker's steadfast refusal to celebrate any of the 19 wickets he took against Australia at Old Trafford in 1956 (Benaud c Statham b Laker 0; Benaud b Laker 18).\n\nBenaud did his best to change all that. Sport was fun, emotional and human: if he got a wicket, he'd do more than hitch his trousers up, Laker-style. He'd whoop and skip and jump: take a look on YouTube at him enjoying Bob Simpson's slip catch at Old Trafford in 1961, where his leg-breaks spirited Australia to a come-from-behind win.\n\nThese days players go further than that. But Benaud was their spiritual forefather.\n\nHe loved not just cricket, but cricketers too. Not everyone was enamoured by his involvement in Kerry Packer's rebellious World Series Cricket in the late 1970s. But WSC eventually forced the Establishment's hand. Cricketers were soon paid a living wage, not the honorariums they had previously endured. Benaud's involvement and influence were central to that.\n\nIt was as a TV commentator that Benaud came into his own. When Wisden asked him in 2003 to dispense some advice to aspiring broadcasters, he suggested: 'Put your brain into gear before opening your mouth.'\n\nThat style – laconic, considered, dry – would become his hallmark, together with an unfailing greeting: 'Good morning, everyone.' When Benaud welcomed viewers, they were able to relax: the cricket was about to begin.\n\nThere were times when you might have longed for him to express himself more trenchantly, to air his opinions more clearly. Surely, you wondered, he must have felt strongly about subjects other than the front-foot no-ball law.\n\nBut it was not his style – and he remained true to himself. 'Above all,' he told Wisden, 'when commentating, don't take yourself too seriously, and have fun.'\n\nBenaud was Australia captain and  the first cricketer to score 2,000 runs and take 200 wickets in Tests\n\nAfter his playing career, Benaud forged an incredibly successful career as a cricket commentator\n\nBenaud (right) in discussion with England's Michael Vaughan ahead of a Test match in 2004\n\nThat last tip has been cheerfully taken on board by the current generation of Channel Nine commentators in Australia. And if they have been less adept at putting their brains into gear before opening their mouths, then that also reflects the almost impossibly high standards set by Benaud himself. His successors were always going to pale by comparison.\n\nBehind it all was a quiet, imposing strength. The first time I met him, Benaud almost broke my fingers with his handshake. As a friend noted: 'You don't get to captain Australia with a limp wrist.'\n\nGood night, everyone.",Richie Benaud has died at the age of 84 after a short battle with skin cancer..

'It's quite correct to say that you are on the cusp of custody and certainly that's in the thoughts of the court.'\n\nHowever, he proceeded to sentence McGowan to the tagging order provided he continues with the counselling.\n\n'If you breach the order you will be brought back here and I have already advised you what the outcome will be,' the sheriff added.\n\nDundee managing director John Nelms, who was accompanied in court by players including captain James McPake, declined to answer questions outside court.\n\nMcGowan also declined to comment but O'Donnell said afterwards: 'He is relieved with the outcome and he knows he needs to modify his behaviour. He appreciates the support of his club and others.'\n\nSorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.",Paul mcgowan avoided a jail sentence after police attack..

But he looked so ill and his skin appeared plastic and his head was misshapen,' she said.\n\n'I also noticed his fingers and toes were sewn together.'\n\nIt was then a doctor broke the news he suspected Billy had Apert syndrome, a genetic abnormality where the bone plates in the skull fuse too early in the womb so the skull is unable to grow normally.\n\nThe condition is caused by a chromosomal defect.\n\nChildren with Apert have bulging eyes that are usually wide-set and tilted down at the sides.\n\nThey may also have problems with tooth alignment due to jaw development problems, suffer from a cleft palate, and may have webbed fingers and toes.\n\nAfter his birth, doctors feared Billy would not last the night.\n\nThe next day Mr and Mrs Mitchell, who live in Hertfordshire, were forced to have a heartbreaking conversation with doctors about turning off his life support machine.\n\nSpecialists feared Billy's nose was totally blocked with misformed and premature fused bone, blocking his airway.\n\nBilly, pictured with his twin sister Lois, has undergone more than 50 operations to have his face rebuilt\n\nBut miraculously, Billy held  on, and in the morning he was transferred to a specialist children's hospital where he had thin, metal tubes called stents inserted into his nose to help him breathe.\n\nHe remained in a critical condition, surrounded by tubes and machines.\n\nFinally, when he was a month old, Mr and Mrs Mitchell were able to take him home to join his twin sister Lois and older sister Darcy, then five.\n\nBut he often stopped breathing in the night, and at 10 weeks old Mrs Mitchell heard him crying.\n\nApert syndrome is a genetic craniofacial abnormality that occurs in around one in 160,000 to 200,000 births.\n\nThe condition is characterised by malformations of the skull, mid-face, hands and feet.\n\nThe skull is prematurely fused and unable to grow normally.\n\nThe mid-face - the area from the middle of the eye socket to the upper jaw - appears sunken.\n\nSome children with the condition have fused fingers and toes.\n\nEarly surgery can relieve the pressure that builds up inside the fused skull as the brain grows.\n\nAnd operations can be carried out to re-model a child's face.\n\nShe noticed that his left eyelid had been pulled behind his eyeball, causing his eye to pop out.\n\nAfter rushing to a doctor, he ended up having his lid sewn shut for a week. \n\nChildren with Apert syndrome have very small eye orbits, meaning more of their eyeball is exposed.\n\nBilly's eye orbits were so shallow, especially the left, that his eye regularly popped out of its socket.\n\nDoctors advised Billy have his eyelid sewn together after he developed a corneal ulcer. \n\nJust six weeks later, he needed a major operation to relieve pressure on his brain, save his sight and reshape his whole head.\n\nKnown as a 'front orbital advancement', surgeons opened his skull, detached it, remodelled his forehead and pieced it together again like a jigsaw.\n\nThey also inserted two pins – each three inches long – into his head.\n\nFor six months, the pins were turned twice a day to create more room inside his head to relieve pressure on his brain. \n\nBilly now needs 24-hour care, which has put a strain on family life.\n\nMrs Mitchell said: 'Luckily Paul and I had a strong relationship and we talked to each other about how we felt.\n\n'But Darcy was still young and had to grow up fast.\n\nWhen Billy was four months old he underwent a major operation to relieve pressure on his brain, save his sight and reshape his whole head\n\nHis fingers were also fused together leaving him struggling to clasp things properly. When he was 17 months old surgeons operated on him to separate Billy's fingers and toes down to the first knuckle\n\n'And as for Lois, every time Billy was admitted to hospital, she'd look around wondering where he was.\n\n'But she was thriving, passing all the usual milestones.\n\n'It was also clear she had a special bond with Billy. Sometimes they'd snuggle up together.\n\n'When she learnt to sit up we propped Billy up with cushions and they'd spend ages playing together. And when Lois became mobile she'd fetch Billy his favourite toys.'\n\nBilly's fingers were fused together – known as 'mitten hands' – and so he struggled to clasp things properly.\n\nBut when he was 17 months old a surgeon at Leeds General Hospital agreed to operate on them.\n\nDuring a nine hour operation, involving bone and skin grafts, he separated Billy's fingers down to the first knuckle and did the same with his toes. In a second operation he finished the process, separating them fully.\n\nMrs Mitchell said: 'Billy had all four limbs in a cast for seven weeks but the results afterwards were amazing.\n\n'He grew in confidence overnight and a couple of weeks later learnt to sit up by himself.\n\n'Bright as a button he'd would watch Lois intently and began to copy her. As a family we were astounded by his progress. So too were the doctors.'\n\nBut the outside world was less understanding, and Mrs Mitchell said people would whisper whenever she took billy out in his pram.\n\n'Walking down the street one day I heard one woman say to her friend: ""God he looks awful"".\n\nEarlier this year Billy had another major operation which left him with a frame fitted to his face for nine weeks\n\n'I was so upset I went straight home.\n\n'Another time when the twins were two and a half we were stood in the queue to see Santa when Darcy noticed some children pointing at Billy.\n\n'She told them not to do it because it was rude. Afterwards I overheard their mother saying: ""Well she shouldn't bring him out should she.""\n\n'If only they knew what Billy was going through.'\n\nBut determined not to wrap their child in cotton wool, Mr and Mrs Mitchell sent Billy to nursery and he went to exactly the same school as his twin sister Lois.\n\nDespite his difficulties he has turned into a typical little boy, obsessed with cars, reading books, and enjoying playing fancy dress with his sister.\n\nSince his most recent surgery, Billy loves his new face, his mother Denise said \n\n'He loved life and was determined to join in with everything,' Mrs Mitchell says. \n\nIn the summer of 2012 he underwent more major surgery.\n\nDuring a nine-hour operation surgeons took the left hand side of his skull off to remodel it and put it back with titanium springs to allow for more growth.\n\nHis condition also left him with a distorted face and his eyes were becoming more and more exposed due to shallow eye sockets and breathing was a struggle.\n\nSo earlier this year he also underwent high risk mid-face surgery, where his face was literally taken apart, reshaped and put back together again to create more room.\n\nHis head was cut from ear to ear and his face cut vertically, with the skin being pulled down, exposing all of the bones of his face and jaw.\n\nHis forehead, eye orbits, nose and top jaw were taken apart, reshaped and put back together with a red frame attached through a series of wires and bolts.\n\nThe frame was left in place for nine weeks to encourage the bone to grow, as well as pull the existing facial bones forward. \n\nThe bones were moved forward a millimeter a day by turning the screws on the frame, a process which allows new bone to grow and then to consolidate.\n\nMrs Mitchell said: 'So far he's endured more than 50 general aesthetics and has been through so much.\n\n'But since his recent surgery he loves his news face. When he saw it for the first time without the frame I think he would have done cartwheels if he could.\n\n'It was a massive boost to his confidence.\n\n'And now, a few months on, he doesn't even associate himself as having Apert syndrome.\n\n'But what's incredible is the way he's taken everything in his stride. We can't thank all the doctors and nurses enough who've looked after him.

He also questioned why the teacher did not receive a blood transfusion earlier and suggested there could be an issue with maternity ward staff overruling women's wishes for their birth plans.\n\nThe inquest was halted in February last year so evidence could be referred to prosecutors to allow them to consider bringing criminal charges.\n\nMr Sheldon said at the time: 'The family has not entered into the process for any other reason than to have questions answered. They are not trying to have anyone convicted, but they do want to find out what happened and why.' \n\nNeighbours said Dr Azeez then moved away in September after splitting up with his wife – who is also a doctor – and selling his house in Tunbridge Wells.

In the next few weeks the Department of Justice (DOJ) will begin to negotiate in earnest with the city to restructure the police department, which the department has charged with engaging in a pattern and practice of racial discrimination.\n\nIt should not be forgotten that the DOJ review of the Ferguson Police Department was precipitated by months of protests and activism following the killing of Michael Brown by a Ferguson police officer and by revelations about the town's dysfunctional government and court system by local civil rights law groups. Now, after a half year of unrest, and with citizens on Tuesday electing two new black city council members, change is beginning to come to Ferguson. The question is, what kind of change?\n\nThe report from the Department of Justice offered a devastating insight into a police department and court system that preyed on its own citizens. Through illegal traffic stops and arrests, and the use of excessive force, the police department held town residents in bondage. The municipal court system used excessive court fines and fees to ensure that citizens arrested for even minor infractions would be charged thousands of dollars or face jail time.\n\nCourt costs and fees constituted the second-largest sources of revenue for the town. Rather than a force for public safety, the Ferguson Police Department became, according to Attorney General Eric Holder, ""a collection agency"" -- one that preyed disproportionately on the town's African-American residents.\n\nThe evidence of ugly and explicit racial discrimination was devastating. It included blatantly racist emails traded among officers, and evidence that African-Americans were victims in all of the police canine bite incidents recorded by the department. But just a few weeks before the release of the report, the Ferguson police chief declared there were ""no racial issues"" in his department.\n\nFerguson's ugly, racist emails released\n\nThe recommendations in the report, ranging from new training and supervision of police officers, addressing racially discriminatory conduct to structural revisions in the court system, will, if implemented, remake the law enforcement system in the town. (A grand jury that investigated the shooting of Brown by Officer Darren Wilson chose not to file charges against him and the Justice Department also didn't find reason to prosecute.)\n\nWithout question, change is coming to the town's government. Town Manager John Shaw, Ferguson's most powerful official and, until the DOJ's blistering report, the one who inexplicably managed to elude public scrutiny, resigned weeks ago and has been replaced by the city's deputy manager. Three sitting city council members chose not to run for office again and, on Tuesday, citizens elected two black candidates to the city council, changing its racial composition: Five of six members and the mayor were white. Now the council will be 50% black.\n\nFerguson's hapless police Chief Thomas Jackson also finally resigned after holding on through a months-long display of astonishing incompetence. The department first drew the attention of the nation for its display of military weaponry and tear gas in response to civilian protests.  The appointment of a commander from the State Highway Patrol was deemed necessary to begin quelling the unrest and to build community trust in the early days of the protest.\n\nJackson's departure sent an important signal to the population of a town preyed upon by officers under his command. And so we can be certain that along with the new makeup of the city council, there will be a new police chief in Ferguson.\n\nBut does that mean that fundamental change will come to Ferguson? Not necessarily. Not unless protest and activism during this critical period turns to influence the vitally important opportunities that lie ahead in the coming weeks. The Department of Justice's full-on negotiations with the leadership in Ferguson will determine the shape of the new Ferguson Police Department.\n\nIndeed, the DOJ report alludes to the possibility of disbanding the department in favor of a regional policing integration with St. Louis County. Many local activists have suggested just such a solution, but given ongoing problems with policing in the county -- including the role of county forces in some of the most controversial clashes with activists in Ferguson last fall -- community representatives will have to fight hard to ensure that the DOJ can fold St. Louis County Police into its monitoring and reform process.\n\nEqually important were the April 7 general elections. Turnout in municipal elections has been notoriously low in Ferguson, with white voters nearly three times more likely to turn out than African-Americans. But local groups had engaged in vigorous voter registration and get-out-the-vote campaigns..\n\nThe Mayor has two years left to his term and has defiantly insisted that he will not resign (although a petition for his recall has been circulating). That means that he will be a lead voice in negotiating with the DOJ to remake the police department. Has he committed to a clear set of principles that will guide his participation in those talks? Community activists and residents must ensure that Mayor James Knowles plans to represent their vision of new Ferguson Police Department.\n\nBut there is an opportunity to begin thinking about even more ambitious structural change in Ferguson and throughout St. Louis County. Ferguson's governing structure, with a strong city manager and a weak council and mayor, mirrors that of thousands of other suburbs in the United States.\n\nThat form of governance might have been precisely what thriving, middle class white suburbanites wanted when they fled racial integration in cities like St. Louis. But working class suburbs like Ferguson with a majority black population in which the needs of the population in the areas of education and economic opportunity more closely hews to the needs of urban residents, may need a more robust form of governance.\n\nIn any case, a system in which the elected officials have minimal power, but non-elected leaders, like the town manager and the chief of police, have inordinate power, is a recipe for the kind of unaccountable, non-representative government that controlled Ferguson's residents. Yet this precise form of government is in wide use across the country.\n\nLikewise, Missouri, like the vast majority of states, holds municipal elections in non-presidential election years, guaranteeing a significantly lower voter turnout -- although only a few states hold the primary and general election in March and April as Missouri law requires Ferguson to do.\n\nIt's not that Ferguson is so different than towns across America. It's precisely because Ferguson holds up a mirror to flaws in our democratic system of government in towns across this country that the stakes are so high.\n\nFerguson residents now have the opportunity to begin a movement for change in the other 89 jurisdictions in St. Louis County plagued by similar governance flaws, including those towns led by African-Americans. And Ferguson's example should provoke self-examination in working class suburbs across the country, where the power and effectiveness of weak elected local government is inadequate to meet the needs of the population.\n\nChange is coming to Ferguson. But the scope and breadth of that change will depend upon the ambition and discipline of activists and residents, whose passion and tenacity have already transformed the trajectory of leadership in a typical American town.","Sherrilyn ifill: a city with a pattern of racial discrimination elected two new black candidates to its city council Tuesday..

The theatre director intended to retire to the property \n\nNow the council has won the right to force Miss Walford to use the equity in the house, where she intended to retire, for care home fees, which can be up to £600 a week.\n\nSolicitors warned that the case could pave the way for relatives across the country to be liable for their parents' care.\n\nCharlotte Kelly, an associate at Worcestershire legal firm Kerwoods, said: 'This was a very significant judgment and one which will affect many in similar situations.'\n\nWhen her mother Mary Walford, now aged 100, was admitted into care in 2006, the council agreed that the house in Stourport-on-Severn should not be taken into account during means testing.\n\nBut in 2013 they reversed their decision and said that Miss Walford would need to begin contributing towards bills. Frustrated by the U-turn, Miss Walford became embroiled in a legal battle with the council which was taken to the High Court in January 2014.\n\nMiss Walford said she had always planned to retire to her mother's house in Stourpour-upon-Severn (above) \n\nThere, a judge ruled that her home should not be taken into account when means testing was carried out on her mother's finances. In his ruling, Justice Supperstone concluded: 'A ""home"" is a place to which a person has a degree of attachment both physical and emotional.'\n\nBut the council took the case to the Court of Appeal, arguing that although the property may be her home, it was not at the time her mother was taken into care. Yesterday Miss Walford said: 'I am now in a position where I will almost certainly have to sell my home to pay for my mother's care bills which will leave me homeless. I have no energy or money left to fight them.'\n\nSunnydene has been in the family for decades and was built by her grandmother's aunt in the mid-1800s. Miss Walford's car is parked in the drive, her belongings fill the bedrooms and she has an office where she carries out her work.\n\nYet she is often posted across the globe and, when working on national productions, needs to be based in London. As a result Miss Walford rents a bedsit owned by a friend in the centre of the capital.\n\nMiss Walford, who has never married and has no children, said: 'Sunnydene is my home. I have lived there since I was 13.\n\n'I pay council tax, the electricity bills and have spent £42,000 renovating it. It was always my intention to retire in the house.\n\nA judge at the Court of Appeal ruled in favour of Worcestershire County Council in January. Earlier the High Court (above) had sided with the Walford family \n\n'It is quite simply my home and it is going to be sold from underneath me. God knows how many other people will face the same heartache following this ruling.' In the Court of Appeal hearing on December 9 last year, her barrister Fraser Campbell argued that the only reason his client did not permanently live at Sunnydene was because her work ties her to London.\n\nBy saying that the house would have been Miss Walford's residence had she not worked in London, the council was discouraging people over the age of 60 from working, Mr Campbell argued.\n\nDespite the submissions, two out of three judges ruled in the council's favour. Lord Justice McCombe, who rejected the council's appeal, said he saw 'no reason' to assess whether the property was Miss Walford's home based on a 'historic' date.\n\nYesterday a Worcestershire Council spokesman said: 'This was an important legal challenge and we are pleased that the Court of Appeal ruled in our favour.\n\n'There are ever increasing demands being made on the public purse and it is important that decisions about how public money is used to support individuals are fair and consistent.'","Glen Walford, 75, grew up In her parents' house In stourport-upon-severn .. The theatre director's mother Mary was forced to move into care In 2006.. Worcestershire County Council tried to sell the house to pay for her care.. But Miss Walford fought them, claiming the property was hers to retire to.. High Court sided with the Walford family who were allowed to keep house..

It caused police systems to be down between four and five days, according to Tewksbury Town Crier.\n\nTewksbury Police Department (above) came under attack by hackers which encrypted their computers' files using a malware program called CryptoLocker. They were forced to pay a $500 in Bitcoinransom\n\nThe only files that were not corrupted were 18 months old, so cops were left paying the ransom in the untraceable digital currency or they risked losing the data forever, according to the Boston Globe.\n\n'Nobody wants to negotiate with terrorists. Nobody wants to pay terrorists,' Police Chief Timothy Sheehan told the Town Crier. 'We did everything we possibly could.\n\n'It was an eye opening experience, I can tell you right now. It made you feel that you lost control of everything. Paying the Bitcoin ransom was the last resort.'\n\nPolice Chief Timothy Sheehan said: 'It made you feel that you lost control of everything. Paying the Bitcoin ransom was the last resort'\n\nThe department was hit with the ransomware on December 7 when access to the infected computers became restricted and a payment was required to recover the files. Police became aware of the malware infection the following day.\n\nComputers were hit with a more recent form of CryptoLocker that authorities did not have the key to, said Sheehan.\n\nIt is believed that the Officer In Charge's computer  became infected and the virus traveled to the largest store of data on the network which held files including arrest logs, motor vehicle records, calls for service and records management, according to the Town Crier.\n\nCryptoLocker is malware that is often installed on computers at the same time. \n\nCryptoLocker locks your computer, encrypts files and demands a ransom for them to be unlocked.\n\nComputers can become corrupted through phishing emails that include malicious attachments and pop-up ads.\n\nAccording to reports from last year, the U.S. Government admitted that at least one police force has been forced to pay a $750 ransom to release sensitive files. \n\nWhen a Tewksbury officer tried to access the data, a demand for $500 was sent from a web address and account that is untraceable by authorities including the FBI and National Security Agency.\n\nAfter this sort of infection occurs there are only two options which include accessing the most recent back-up or paying the ransom.\n\nAs Tewksbury's back-up was corrupted they were forced to pay the ransom, but Sheehan also noted that the malware infection was not a data breach.\n\n'This isn't a breach. [The data] stays interior, but this virus encrypts it and prevents it from being readable,' Sheehan told the Town Crier.\n\nTewksbury is not the first police department to be a victim of ransomware in the U.S.\n\nSimilar incidents have occurred involving Swansea Police Department which paid a $750 ransom in November 2013, according to Town Crier.\n\nPolice in Midlothian, Illinois most recently paid a $500 ransom in January.","Tewksbury Police Department was attacked by criminals who infected their network with  malware program called cryptolocker..

There will be 14 races through the afternoon. And in addition to the honor and prestige, the camels are racing for thousands of dollars in prize money and fancy new cars for their owners.\n\nIt's surprising how spectacular camel racing can be. Compared to the grace of thoroughbred racehorses, camels are indeed ungainly creatures.\n\nBut 20 of these huge beasts pounding around a track in the desert is really a sight to behold, their hooves throwing up a cloud of dust in their wake. Their owners hang out of their four-by-fours, shouting encouragement while trying to keep up with their charges. It is oddly beautiful.\n\nThe winning camels are paraded with pride, their heads and necks covered in bright golden saffron and their owners applauded for their efforts and rewarded with cash prizes.\n\nAs we excitedly watch the final race draw to a close, the sun sets across the sky of this metropolis.

It was the day after my little brother, Jimmy, died of cancer. He was 25. I was so angry at God.\n\nI was 27 at the time, and, like most young people I had stopped going to church. But, on that day -- that terrible day -- I desperately needed to understand why God took my brother. I called the nearest Catholic church, looking for a priest. A lady picked up the phone. ""Can I talk with Father?"" I asked.\n\nI wish I could say her answer was ""yes.""\n\nInstead, she asked me if I was a member of that particular parish. ""Does it matter?"" I asked. (At the time I lived far from my home parish.) I don't remember how she responded, but the answer about my being able to see Father was clearly no.\n\nI don't know if all Catholic churches would have shut me out, but I figured, at the time, it was part of the long list of rules the Vatican required Catholic leaders to follow. I cried for a bit, then decided I would never ask God for anything. Clearly, his conduits on Earth did not have time for me -- a lifelong Catholic -- and sinner -- so why would he?\n\nEver since, I've considered myself a lapsed Catholic.\n\nUntil Pope Francis.\n\nThere is something about Francis that's reawakened my faith. And it's not because he opened the floodgates to allow sin in the eyes of the church. He still argues against things I passionately support, but I find myself -- like many other lapsed Catholics -- enthralled.\n\nRecently I had the pleasure of meeting one of the Pope's newly appointed cardinals. His name is Cardinal Gerald Lacroix. The 57-year-old presides at the Basilica Cathedral of Notre Dame in Quebec City.\n\nOne of my first questions: What is it about Pope Francis?\n\n""Every person is a mystery you know. ... But what's evident is this man is living with such freedom, such inner freedom. He's himself. He's in tune with the Lord,"" Lacroix  told me.\n\n""Those close to him say he's up close to 4 in the morning to prepare his daily Mass, which is at 7 in the morning on the weekdays. So that's almost three hours of prayer, preparation and silence before the Lord and the word of God. Wow, that really fine-tunes you to start off a day.""\n\nPerhaps that's how the Pope stays humble. Why he defies tradition and washes the feet of the disabled, women and those of other faiths. Why he ordered showers to be built for the poor in St. Peter's Square.\n\nAll of this is appealing, but it's more than that. In my mind, it's his tone. When Pope Francis said, ""If a person is gay and he searches for the Lord and has good will, who am I to judge?"" The comment took me aback. Homosexuality has long been a taboo subject for the Vatican, yet Pope Francis uttered those welcoming words.\n\nLacroix likened the Pope's approach to Jesus. ""Jesus didn't judge. Jesus did not come as a judge. He came as someone who preached and talked about the love of God.""\n\nThose kinds of answers are so different in my experience, but I understand why more conservative Catholics worry. If the Pope does not judge, then who will tell us who is a sinner and who is not?\n\n""I hear that sometimes, too,"" Lacroix told me. ""I think Pope Francis is conservative in the right way. You have to be conservative enough to come back to what is the foundation: that's the Gospel. You cannot reproach Pope Francis of not living the Gospel, or not preaching the truth of the Gospel.""\n\nBut isn't homosexuality a sin in the eyes of the church?\n\n""There is room for everyone. The door is open,"" Cardinal Lacroix insisted. ""Of course you know that the Catholic Church will never promote same sex marriage, but do we respect homosexual persons? Do we welcome them? Do we accompany them? Of course. But to respect the Church and its teaching, which is based on a long tradition and also the word of God, we will not go so far as to bless. But that doesn't mean we reject.""\n\nThat last sentiment -- ""that doesn't mean we reject."" -- did it for me.\n\nI finally understood why Pope Francis reawakened my faith. I always felt my church would reject me for committing the smallest of sins. Like calling a priest at a church that was not my home parish. Like not covering my head with a traditional veil at Easter. Like accidentally eating meat on Holy Friday. Like supporting the use of contraception.\n\nBut as Lacroix told me, Jesus walked with sinners until the very end. He did not banish them to fires of hell, for He refused to give up on anyone.\n\nThe Cardinal's last words to me: ""I'm trying to do my best on (the) local level -- to have an open ear to what the church and world are experiencing. To see how we can today respond to those needs. I want people to see me, and the church, as an open heart to grow together. Not a church that's imposing -- we have nothing to impose -- we have someone to propose: the Lord Jesus and his Gospel.""\n\nI can't wait to go church next Sunday. And, yes, I will bow my head and pray for forgiveness, and if I'm worthy, Christ's love.","There is something about Pope Francis that's reawakened her faith, say cnn's carol costello..

Her two daughters and her son Benedict, then 21, had gone out. \n\nThe following day, the 51-year-old nurse's naked body was found at the foot of the stairs by builders who had turned up to do work on the detached house in Sprigs Holly Lane, Radnage near Chinnor in Buckinghamshire.\n\nA post mortem revealed she died of head injuries, which detectives believe were probably inflicted by a blunt instrument like a crowbar.\n\nThe motive remains unclear with police describing the circumstances of the crime as 'unusual', adding they 'keeping an open mind'.\n\nOne possible line of inquiry was that it had been a break-in gone wrong, but while a window was broken and the burglar alarm triggered, nothing was taken from the home.\n\nThere was also no evidence Mrs Brown had been sexually assaulted.\n\nPeter Beirne, right, of the cold case squad and Mrs Brown's daughters Roxanne, centre and Zara, right, appealed for information about the 'heinous' crime revealing forensics experts now had the suspect's DNA \n\nThere was no evidence of a sexual assault at the crime scene in Radnage in Buckinghamshire, pictured\n\nMembers of Mrs Brown's family, pictured, made a similar appeal 20 years ago following her brutal murder\n\nDetectives said that whomever the attacker was had brought the hand-cuffs and tape used to restrain Mrs Brown along with them.\n\nDespite what police called a 'thorough and professional investigation' at the time the killer has eluded capture, leaving her broken-hearted family without justice.\n\nIn a bid to finally find the culprit, detectives turned to modern scientific techniques to analyse clues found at the time.\n\nPeter Beirne, the head of Thames Valley Police's major crime investigation review team, revealed a DNA sample belonging to an unknown person had now been successfully extracted.\n\n'These new tests have produced a DNA sample,' he said.\n\n'It does not belong to the family and we believe it could be a vital piece of evidence linking the killer to the scene.'\n\nHe would not reveal what item the DNA sample was taken from.\n\nPolice say there are plans to swab a number of people who featured in the original investigation, but stress there were 'no suspects, as such' - there have never been any arrests over the case.\n\nInstead, Mr Beirne said he was first appealing to the public to put forward names of anyone they believe may have been involved, who would then be tested.\n\nIt would then be 'a simple task to either eliminate or implicate people as the source of the DNA', he added.\n\nMr Beirne, a retired veteran police officer with more than 30 years experience as a detective, said if nothing useful comes to light then investigators may then look at 'a potential mass screening' in the area.\n\nHe said: 'Janet's death left three children without a mother.\n\n'We want to bring justice to Janet's family.\n\n'If people have suspicions, I would urge them to contact police.'\n\nMr Beirne added: 'Somebody out there knows who killed Janet - we're asking them to make contact.'\n\nAlso appealing to the public, Roxanne Brown said: 'We need your help to find them.'\n\nIt was revealed had she survived, Mrs Brown would now be a grandmother with detectives saying the youngsters had been robbed of the chance to know her.\n\nA £20,000 reward is being offered for information leading to a successful conviction of the killer.\n\nAnyone who believes they may have any information about the crime is urged to call the police on 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111. \n\nCold case detectives have relaunched a murder inquiry 25 years after a man was reported missing by his girlfriend.\n\nAndrew Bedford was 27-years-old when he disappeared in 1990.

The only accessory missing were their welfare caps, which they must have left at home.\n\nScroll down for video \n\nIn the corridors of power, Samantha Cameron, Justine Miliband  (left) and Miriam Clegg (right) proved once more that they are the ones who wear the trousers, in more ways than one\n\nSam Cam put her best foot forward on the campaign trail in west London. Well, almost. Badge on lapel, leaflets in hand, smart white loafers tripping lightly over the Hounslow flagstones, she looked every inch the groomed and polished loyal Conservative wife. That was until she visited a Sikh family for a cup of tea. Mrs Cameron respectfully took her shoes off before entering the home of local businessman Baljinder Hansraas and before anyone could scream: 'Holy footcream!' she unleashed them.\n\nOut popped a pair of startling tootsies, displaying what might just have been a hint of a bunion. All across the Home Counties, fragrant Tory women fell into a dead faint. For Sam Cam's seldom seen feet seemed ever so slightly unkempt, unusual from a woman noted for her effortless elegance. They didn't even seem very Tory toenails. Shriek – not even a drop of nail polish! I don't know what the grooming squad will have to say about that, but I doubt it will be very flattering.\n\nSam Cam put her best foot forward on the campaign trail in west London. Well, almost. Badge on lapel, leaflets in hand, smart white loafers tripping lightly over the Hounslow flagstones, she looked every inch the groomed and polished loyal Conservative wife\n\nPerhaps we should not be too harsh. Not many women would come out smelling of roses and peppermint foot lotion if they unexpectedly had to reveal their workaday feet, still slightly steaming from punishing the pavements, to the nation.\n\nYesterday's shock unveiling of Crinkletoes Cameron was reminiscent of a moment during the last election, when Sarah Brown's mangled trotters were revealed on a visit to a Hindu temple. The same furore greeted Brown's podiatric horror story. And the message was the same. Woman goes out in public without painted toenails? The end of civilisation is nigh.\n\nPoor Sam Cam. If she had unveiled the perfect trimmed pedicure and three glistening coats of Rouge Noir, she would be accused of being self-indulgent. Wasting money on luxuries or wandering around with battered trotters. She can't win. But in this election, who can?\n\nJustine resolutely wore the exact same outfit she wore last week, sending out a Take Me Serious message that Clothes Don't Matter. Campaigning in Bradford, she looked like a grim pixie determined to prove to the Milifans that her man was the man. Or something like that.\n\nIt was left to Miriam to show a bit of wackitude, pulling on a huge smile, a pair of Lib Dem yellow chinos and a nautical Breton top; she looked like Tweety Pie reporting for duty on the good ship Doomed. Miriam dragged her husband Nick along to a cookery lesson at a Wiltshire primary school.\n\n Aprons on, they exchanged loving looks as they and the pupils were shown how to make a variety of desserts using apples and blackberries. Soft fruit, fool, pudding and crumble? That is the history of the Lib Dems right there.\n\nJust a week to go and the wifely bandwagon rolls on. Their role is to be there, be visible, be bland and say nothing of import. In this carefully manicured – if not pedicured – election, the days of loudmouth Cherie wading in like a docker with gout have long gone. I almost miss them.\n\nToday's wives must smile nicely. Today's wives must not rock the boat. Today's wives must wear ordinary high street clothes and nothing that hints at their secret, massive wealth – although Samantha's two hundred quid spotty blouse must have slipped under Tory central office radar. Above all, however, today's wives must remember that pulling your socks up is not as important as keeping them on.",All the party leader's wives have been spotted looking stylish in trousers ..

Ask the wrong question and you find your interviewee walking out on you mid sentence. \n\nWhich is exactly what happened when Channel 4 news presenter Krishnan Guru-Murthy tried to ask the actor Robert Downey Jr about his drug-taking past. \n\nAfter questioning the 50-year-old actor as to whether he had managed to fight his demons the actor said: 'I'm sorry, I really don't... what are we doing?' before walking out of the interview. \n\nChannel 4 presenter Krishnan Guru-Murthy looks bemused as Robert Downey Junior walks out on an interview with him after the journalist asked him about his personal life \n\nIn the footage of the short-lived chat Krishnan is then seen looking dumbfounded as Robert goes to head out of the room.\n\nThe American star is in London to promote his new film Avengers: Age of Ultron but became aggravated when the chat took a turn for the personal. \n\nSeemingly amused with the reaction, Guru-Murthy is then seen smiling and gesticulating as a production team-member tried to remove Robert's clip-on microphone.\n\nAt that point he turns and says: 'It's all getting a bit Diane Sawyer [a U.S. journalist known for her investigative interviewing].' \n\nThe horror was clear to see on Robert's face as he questioned Krishnan about where he was trying to take their chat \n\nBut Robert isn't the first celebrity to lose his cool in the face of an awkward line of questioning.  \n\nNaomi Campbell, Robert Pattinson and Peter Andre have all cut their chat time short - especially when, like with Mr Downey Jr, the conversation has turned to their private lives. \n\nJustin Bieber was once angered by a radio show host asked him about his friendship with One Direction and compared him to Justin Timberlake. \n\nAnd Rihanna became annoyed in Australia and cut off a chat about her film Battleship when questions began to focus on her love life. \n\nHere are the celebrities who couldn't stand the heat so they got out of the interview:  \n\nThe model Naomi Campbell is known for her firey temper and stormed out of an interview - breaking a camera in her wake - after being asked about a blood diamond she had apparently been given\n\nNAOMI CAMPBELL \n\nIn April 2010 Naomi Campbell, who is known for her fiery temper, stormed out of an interview with ABC news kicking their camera over on the way. \n\nThe reporter had asked the supermodel about whether she had received a blood diamond from the deposed Liberian despot Charles Taylor.\n\nNaomi said: 'I didn't receive a blood diamond and I'm not going to speak about that.' \n\nThe interviewer continued to push the 44-year-old until she ended the chat curtly saying: 'Thank you very much,' and walking off.\n\nIn court Naomi later admitted that she had been given, 'a few dirty rocks,' by Taylor when she testified against him.  \n\nRobert Pattinson became incredibly awkward whilst, when promoting Twilight: New Moon, he was asked about his relationship with Kristen Stewart \n\nROBERT PATTINSON \n\nWhen Robert Pattinson was promoting the Twilight film New Moon in 2009 he had an awkward run-in with Ryan Seacrest. \n\nRyan starts the interview by asking Rob about how he is finding fame but the conversation quickly turned to his then relationship with his co-star Kristen Stewart. \n\nRyan quizzed the actor on what he tells fans when they ask about their relationship at which point his PR swiftly interjects and reprimands the Radio host.  \n\nRob becomes visibly awkward and is ushered out of the interview as a stunned Seacrest reveals that it's the first time he's ever been cut off. \n\nAs Rob leaves he jokes that he would tell his fans to watch this film but it doesn't do anything to ease the awkward tension. \n\nJustin Bieber might be close friends with One Direction but he didn't like it when a radio host asked about whether Harry Styles would flirt with his mum \n\nJUSTIN BIEBER \n\nIn 2012 pop singer Justin Bieber did an incredibly awkward interview with the online American radio show, MOJO In The Morning. \n\nThe host describes how the interview went 'horribly wrong,' saying that Justin initially got offended when he compared him to Justin Timberlake. \n\nJustin says: 'That's crazy 'cos our voices sound nothing alike... saying I sound like someone is not really a compliment.' \n\nHe then got upset when the interviewer started asking him about One Direction, in particular Harry Styles.   \n\nThe presenter questions him: 'Do you worry about Harry around your mum as he seems to like older women?' to which Justin retorts, 'I think you should worry about me round your mum, so...'\n\nThe radio host then informs Justin that his mum is dead and the pop star hangs up on him. An awkward chat with Justin's 'people' ensued in which MOJO are told the singer won't be calling back. \n\nPeter Andre tried to keep his cool when he was interviewed by Kay Burley in 2010 but when the conversation turned to his children the TV presenter managed to reduce him to tears \n\nPETER ANDRE \n\nIn 2010 Peter Andre joined Kay Burley on the coach for Sky News and she proceeded to prod him on his ex-wife Katie Price's recent marriage to Alex Reid. \n\nIn particular the TV presenter was keen to know whether Peter and Katie's children were aware that their mother had re-married. \n\nWhich lead them on to the subject of the model's first son Harvey. Harvey was the child of Price and footballer Dwight Yorke - although he was largely bought up by Andre, who still plays a role in his life to this day. \n\nDuring the segment Kay played Peter a clip of Dwight insinuating that the singer should never have said that he wanted to adopt the boy with whom the footballer has very little contact. \n\nAn understandably defensive Peter went on to question whether Yorke had seen his son and to question why he Dwight would find Peter disrespectful when all he did was love his son. \n\nKay then asked Peter how he would feel is Alex Reid wanted to adopt his two children Junior and Princess at which point the singer became upset asking for the interview to be terminated.  \n\nRihanna cut an interview with Australian show Sunrise short when the interviewer asked her about her love life\n\nRIHANNA \n\nRihanna was in Australia to promote her film Battleship in April 2012 when she became angry with a reporter from the show Sunrise. \n\nDuring an interview reporter Natalie Barr asked the star how frustrating it was to be linked to Hollywood names even if she wasn't dating them.\n\nTo which Rihanna replied: 'Very frustrating. Almost as frustrating as being asked about it.' \n\nShe went on to say: 'People are interested in a lot of things that don't matter or shouldn't.' Before ending the interview. \n\nIt wasn't exactly S Club 7 themselves who decided to walk out on Claudia Winkleman who had an interview cut short with the band by their PR \n\nS CLUB 7\n\nIn one of the most bizarre celebrity walk-outs of all time S Club 7 were forced to leave an interview with Claudia Winkleman by their screaming PR. \n\nIt was 2003 and the band were discussing their imminent split with the TV presenter when she began to ask them about money. \n\nIt had been rumoured at the time that, despite their manager Simon Fuller being worth around £90million, the band hadn't been making enough money. \n\nClaudia asked them: 'There are rumours, I don't know how true they are, that you guys are grumpy that you haven't made a mint..'\n\nThe bands PR then storms in saying: 'I'm not having this! I've had to come on here to get you to stop. Can you get up? We're going.'\n\nThe Bee Gees had one of the most famous walk outs ever when they cut an interview with Clive Anderson short \n\nBEE GEES \n\nIt's one of the most famous walk outs of all time when in 1997 Clive Anderson managed to annoy not one, not two but all three of the Bee Gees. \n\nClive tries to joke with the band but after calling Barry Gibb a 't*****' he said: 'We're getting on like a storm, aren't we Clive? In fact I might just leave.'\n\nRobin and Maurice then followed at which point Clive revealed that he'd never had someone walk off before.","Robert Downey Jr walked out of an interview with Channel 4..

Brides slam 'disgraceful' treatment at hands of wedding dress company that shut down leaving them without a dress and out of pocket\nIn February of this year, bride-to-be Adele McKenzie found the dress she had dreamed of wearing when she married her partner of nine years, David Elliot. \n\nLittle did she know she would never get the chance to wear it, despite already paying for half. \n\nThe 31-year-old said when she slipped into the white lacy gown, she instantly saw herself standing in front of her friends and family and exchanging marriage vows with the love of her life.\n\n'I had dreamt about this princess dress since I was a little girl,' she told Daily Mail Australia.\n\nAdele McKenzie was set to marry the love of her life, David Elliot, when she was devastated to learn the bridal company she had paid around $1,000 to for her dress had closed down\n\nMs McKenzie said she wasn't able to buy the $2,000 dress outright so she organised a payment plan with 'The Bridal Centre'.\n\nShe started paying in February and planned to pay off her dress by July - around three months before her wedding - giving her time to make alterations. \n\nIn early April, Ms McKenzie's dress dream was shattered when she opened an email from the bridal company that said they were going bankrupt.\n\nMs McKenzie told Daily Mail Australia she was left feeling 'panicked' and 'anxious' when she was faced with the news that she would need to find a new wedding dress for her big day.\n\n'My first reaction was to call The Bridal Centre and it was consistently busy across the long weekend. Their Facebook was active and we were putting up posts without a response.'\n\nThe Bridal Centre's Facebook page was inundated with messages from disappointed brides who already had their hearts set on a wedding dress\n\nMs McKenzie was one of around 140 brides who received the same 'generic' email informing them their dream dresses may not be coming, some of them with their weddings only weeks away.\n\nShe tried to go onto the Bridal Centre's website but it was deactivated and that's when she realised she had no way of getting in contact with the company she already paid $1,000, which was meant to go towards paying off her dress.\n\nThe happy couple have been together for nine years and plan to wed in November 2015\n\n'It was stressful and pretty upsetting,' she said.\n\nMs McKenzie was one of around 140 brides who received the same 'generic' email informing them their dream dresses may not be coming, some of them with weddings only weeks away.\n\nAmid the devastation, the brides-to-be banded together to create a Facebook page that would allow them to 'connect' and 'support each other' through the confusing time.\n\nMs McKenzie said the group called 'Where's My Dress?' became inundated with 'generous offers' from 'lovely ladies' and 'amazing bridal companies' who offered them free 'pre-loved', and even brand new, wedding gowns.\n\nWhile some women have received their money back, unfortunately Ms McKenzie said she is still waiting to hear from the Bridal Centre about whether she will be one of the lucky ones who can use that money to buy another dress.\n\nMs McKenzie revealed she would need another $1,000 deposit to move forward with a different dress, however at this stage, with all the financial pressure that comes with planning a wedding, she isn't sure she can afford it.\n\n'It's very difficult financially, I can't take the next step to get another dress. I don't know if I'm going to get it back.'\n\n'I am six months out of my wedding and I'm anxious and stressed out,' she said. \n\nAmid the devastation, the brides-to-be banded together to create a Facebook page that would allow them to 'connect' and 'support each other' through the confusing time.\n\nMs McKenzie is expecting around 70 guests at her wedding that will be held in Sydney's Terrey Hills, with some travelling from interstate and overseas.   \n\n'There's a lot of planning and  it's added pressure on top.'\n\n'It's getting more difficult as the weeks draw closer,' she added.\n\nMs McKenzie said the trusting brides had no idea the company was facing financial difficulties as they continued to take payments from their clients right up until the day before they sent the email that notified them of their money woes.\n\n'[It] is just disgraceful. They knew what was happening. If they didn't want to tell us the truth, that's fine, but don't take our money,' she said.\n\n'At the end of the day, I'm marrying the man of my dreams so I'm trying to not let it affect it too much.'\n\nAfter thinking she had secured the dress she had dreamed of since she was a little girl, Ms McKenzie said she was devastated she was going to have to fight to get it back.\n\n'You find this dress and you fall in love with it. Now I have to go through this process, it's so upsetting.\n\n'I don't want this,' she added.\n\nMs McKenzie said despite her awful experience she is trying to move forward and instead focus on  on the man who will be standing at the end of the aisle, regardless of what she is wearing.\n\n'At the end of the day, I'm marrying the man of my dreams so I'm trying to not let it affect it too much.'","The Bridal Centre, in brisbane, shut down unexpectedly earlier this month..

According to a Wall Street Journal report Thursday, Chinese nuclear experts have told the United States that Pyongyang may already have as many as 20 nuclear warheads. And while that number may seem stunning, it is actually only part of a troubling story.\n\nThe key takeaway from the latest assessment of North Korea's nuclear capability is not in the actual number of warheads, but the type of warhead, as this gives a better clue to the future of the country's weapons capabilities.\n\nTrue, the reported Chinese estimate of 20 warheads is large enough to constitute a nuclear ""arsenal."" However, this number is not actually significantly larger than conventional open source estimates of 10 to 15 warheads previously provided by U.S. and other experts.\n\nThe big takeaway from the report is instead the prediction that North Korea could be in a position to double its arsenal by next year with weapons-grade uranium. If that assessment is correct, and Pyongyang can indeed boost its nuclear stockpile by the end of this year to around 40 warheads by utilizing highly-enriched weapons-grade uranium, then the plutonium program that the U.S. and members of the Six-Party talks had been negotiating over this past quarter century would suddenly seem trivial. After all, the plutonium program might be capable of spitting out maybe a few weapons worth of plutonium annually. This news could be much more serious.\n\nWhy? For a start, it would mean that North Korea's activities would undoubtedly meet the definition, if it had not already, of a runaway nuclear weapons program, with the potential to be fueled by a large supply of raw uranium buried in North Korea's mines. In addition, while the plutonium program at Yongbyon has a clear and detectable profile, the thousands of centrifuges that spin in a uranium-based program have no detectable heat signature or topographic profile, meaning you could store the stuff not just in the labyrinth of underground tunnels in North Korea, undetectable from the sky, but in any large warehouse.\n\nWashington and Seoul have tended to have a policy that leans toward downplaying North Korean threats, at least when there isn't a full-fledged crisis going on. For example, the United States downplayed North Korea's missile threat until the country successfully put a satellite into orbit in December 2012. And up until 2006, no one thought the Kim regime would actually dare undertake a nuclear test. These new estimates could therefore be a timely reminder that we may have downplayed the threat North Korea poses once again.\n\nBut Thursday's report isn't the only troubling information we have had recently. Just as concerning is the NORAD commander's assessment on North Korea's missile capabilities. On April 7, Adm. Bill Gortney said during a press briefing that the Defense Department believed Pyongyang's KN-08 intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) is operational, with a warhead capacity.\n\nThis statement is troubling for two reasons. First, Gortney's statement, when combined with the latest Chinese assessment, implies that North Korea now not only has nuclear weapons, but the ability to miniaturize such weapons for a warhead that could be placed atop a missile with range rings extending to the U.S. mainland.\n\nSecond, and just as importantly, Pyongyang's advances in mobile ICBM capabilities could end up undermining the state of stable deterrence that currently exists on the Korean Peninsula. Put simply, these capabilities could give North Korea confidence that it is immune from any U.S. counterstrikes.\n\nAnd if that ends up being the case, the United States could find itself with a renewed headache in Asia -- and its carefully calibrated plans for its pivot to the region crumbling.",Report says North Korea may have as many as 20 nuclear warheads..

'Gross household debt in Portugal and the United Kingdom is projected to remain high compared with that of other advanced economies.' Soaring house prices have pushed up household debt in Britain in recent years – raising fears that families are over-stretching themselves to get on the property ladder or buy a bigger home.\n\nThe Bank of England has clamped down on the sort of risky mortgage lending that was rife in the build-up to the financial crisis, in an effort to prevent another housing boom and bust. But the IMF said: 'Containing financial stability risks from housing and mortgage markets remains important.'\n\nIt also said 'measures to increase housing supply are a priority' for the UK given the shortage of homes and swelling population. Both the Tories and Labour have promised to step-up house building after the General Election.\n\nIMF figures showed household debt in the UK was worth 87.1 per cent of gross domestic product, or total economic output, last year.\n\nThat compares with 82.6 per cent in Portugal and 76.9 per cent in the United States. Debt levels are far lower in much of Europe, at 72 per cent in Spain, around 55 per cent in Germany and France, and just over 40 per cent in Italy.\n\nDouro River, Porto, Portugal: The IMF report lumped Britain together with a country that was forced to seek emergency funding during the eurozone crisis\n\nA separate report will today claim 13million Britons will dive further into debt this year – a 40 per cent rise on 2014. The survey of 2,000 people found that, of the two-thirds of British adults already in debt from credit cards, overdrafts and loans, a quarter will have to borrow even more to cope.\n\nKevin Mountford of MoneySuperMarket.com, which was behind the research, said: 'It's important that those relying on credit keep in control of the situation, so their debt doesn't spiral out of control.\n\n'Simply working out a realistic monthly budget and cutting out unnecessary expenditure should be the first step.'\n\n THE cost of moving house has soared to £12,000, figures show.\n\nRising estate agents' fees, removal costs and stamp duty helped push the total bill up 60 per cent between 2004 and last year – double the inflation rate.\n\nAnd it is forecast to hit £15,000 in five years despite recent reforms to curb stamp duty costs.\n\nThe sky-high price of moving does not include the deposit – £90,000 for the average buyer.\n\nExperts said it could be putting families off moving house at a time when demand for properties has already fallen away.\n\nA study by the Centre for Economics and Business Research found the bill for moving typically includes more than £5,000 in estate agents' fees, £3,600 in stamp duty and £1,400 in solicitors' conveyancing bills.\n\nPaula Higgins, of consumer group the HomeOwners' Alliance, said: 'This is more bad news for struggling families.'",Borrowing to buy has left UK more indebted than other developed nations..

Either prices are inflated or you're picking up problem players other clubs don't want.\n\nThis year, it seems, has proved no different. Big-money buys have struggled to impact, while loan signings, too, have not had the desired effect.\n\nHere, Sportsmail looks at five winter-window arrivals who have disappointed for their new employers…\n\nJuan Cuardrado arrived at Chelsea for £23m from Fiorentina but has failed to impress at Stamford Bridge\n\nJuan Cuadrado (Chelsea)\n\nFor a fee in the region of £23m and arriving from Fiorentina with a reputation bloated by his impressive performance for Colombia at last summer's World Cup, Cuadrado was expected to help fire Chelsea towards the Premier League and Champions League crowns.\n\nIn nearly three months, however, he has played just over three hours of top-flight football, failing to score or create a goal in that period.\n\nThe Colombian winger arrived with a big reputation after starring at the 2014 World Cup\n\nMeanwhile, during the Champions League exit to PSG, Cuadrado appeared for just 11 minutes and remained a spectator as they were eliminated following the second leg at Stamford Bridge.\n\nPerhaps next season was always pencilled in for the explosive winger to make his impact, but the jury remains very much out based on his early efforts.\n\nWilfried Bony (Man City)\n\nWith Sergio Aguero perennially troubled by injury problems and Edin Dzeko about as reliable as his team-mate's hamstrings, £28m Swansea striker Bony was supposed to be the man to take on the scoring mantle and see home City's defence of their title.\n\nWilfried Bony has netted only one goal as Manchester City have slipped out of the title race\n\nHis arrival, of course, was delayed by participation at the Africa Cup of Nations, but Bony has done little to breathe new life into City's stuttering season.\n\nThere has been just one goal – the opener in a routine 3-0 home win over West Brom – and he has missed the last two matches – including the derby defeat at Manchester United – after turning an ankle in training.\n\nThe former Swansea striker scored more Premier League goals than any other player in 2014\n\nHe has started just two games and his involvement during the Champions League defeat to Barcelona was restricted to 18 minutes at the Nou Camp.\n\nBony will have to hit the ground running next season or his days at City could soon be numbered.\n\nMauro Zarate (QPR)\n\nPerhaps the Argentinian should have taken the hint when Harry Redknapp tried to send him back to West Ham before he had even kicked a ball for the R's.\n\nMauro Zarate has failed to make an impression at Loftus Road during his loan\n\nPremier League rules meant he had to stay and, four substitute appearances later, Zarate is yet to score or lay on a goal for his latest employers.\n\nZarate fared slightly better at Birmingham City in 2008 when, during another loan stay, he netted four times.\n\nZarate scored two goals in seven appearances for West Ham before being farmed out on loan\n\nThat, though, was not enough to keep the Blues in the Premier League and it looks as if he'll have a second relegation on his C.V. come May.\n\nCallum McManaman (West Brom)\n\nThe £4.75m capture of McManaman from Wigan was hailed as something of a coup given how he had impressed for the Latics on occasion.\n\nCallum McManaman's move to the Hawthorns has coincided with West Brom's slip into relegation battle\n\nBut therein lies the problem with the combative forward – getting him on the pitch and keeping him there.\n\nTalented, no doubt, but McManaman's progress at The Hawthorns has been curtailed by an ankle problem and six appearances later he is yet to trouble the scorers.\n\nThe Scotland international was one of the stars of Wigan's unlikely FA Cup victory in 2013\n\nHe hasn't featured for over a month and, in that time, West Brom have slid back towards the relegation mire.\n\nMcManaman's arrival was intended to help safeguard against such a scenario, so in that respect the signing has disappointed.\n\nFilip Djuricic (Southampton)\n\nBig things were expected of the Serbia international given Ronald Koeman's prior knowledge of the skilful winger – who played for Heerenveen in Holland - and Southampton's recent record in the transfer market.\n\nRonald Koeman brought in the talented forward, but Filip Djuricic is yet to complete 90mins for the Saints\n\nThere have been flashes of promise but the 23-year-old is yet to play a full 90 minutes for the Saints and now finds himself sidelined with an ankle problem.\n\nDjuricic – on loan from Benfica – wants to make permanent his stay on the south coast, but injury could rob him of the chance to impress.\n\nThe on-loan Benfica winger (left) will have to do more to make his move to St Mary's permanent",Several january signings have failed to impress in the Premier League.. Chelsea winger juan Cuardrado has barely played since Fiorentina move.. Wilfried Bony has scored one goal after leaving Swansea for man City..

To be honest we never ever thought we would hear very much at all so when we got this beautiful card we were chuffed to bits.\n\n'I was absolutely delighted. This was such a personal thing. We were really, really chuffed. \n\nAndy continues to maintain a close bond with the town - after winning Wimbledon,  he shook hands with all the shop owners on the Dunblane High street.  \n\nWhen Murray, 27, says 'I do' on April 11, the guests wishing them well will be largely a gathering of close family and friends.\n\nA local butcher has poems about the happy couple in the shop window \n\nMurray's status as one of the world's best tennis players means he has mixed with everyone from A-list celebrities such as James Corden to the Prime Minister and even the Queen. \n\nBut the biggest name likely to be in attendance at Dunblane Cathedral, where the couple are tying the knot, is one-time British tennis star Tim Henman.\n\nIndeed, when the sport's world number one, Novak Djokovic, was asked by a journalist recently if he would be attending the celebration, he replied with a curt: 'Not invited', before following up with a more charitable: 'But I wish him all the best.'\n\nA sign telling people about parking restrictions around Dunblane Cathedral ahead of Andy's wedding to Kim\n\nMurray has said: 'There won't be any celebrities as such.\n\n'I don't have any celebrity friends so it wasn't something that was planned. \n\n'[It'll be] Everyone who we're close to, people we've spent a lot of time with in the past but also people we see ourselves spending time with in the future. \n\n'That's how we came up with the names. Pretty much everything is done now and under control. I'm sure a few things will come up next week but it's pretty much sorted.'\n\nThere will be names from the tennis world in attendance but certainly not players who are as well known as the likes of Nadal or Federer. \n\nDunblane Cathedral, where the couple will hold their nuptials \n\nMurray has invited Dutch doubles player Jules Rojer, who he spends time with while training in Miami and Davis Cup team mate James Ward. \n\nAnother British pro Jamie Delgado will also attend. \n\nFor the 27-year-old's many fans and friends in the town,  at least part of the wedding of the year will be a spectator sport, played out on the streets of the community.\n\nIt is understood local residents and businesses urged the former Wimbledon champion to hold the April 11 service at the cathedral rather than at luxury hotel Cromlix House in nearby Kinbuck – so they too could toast his big day. The reception will be held at Cromlix, which Murray owns. \n\nKim shows off her engagement ring at the Australian Open in Melbourne, Australia, last January \n\nThe 300-seat, 12th century cathedral is much bigger than the chapel at Cromlix, which seats only 28. Thousands are expected to line Dunblane High Street on the day.\n\nMurray's uncle Niall Erskine said: 'I'm sure it will be a popular decision, as he's had so much support from the people of Dunblane in the past.\n\nAndy has admitted that, food aside, he's left much of the preparation for the big day to his betrothed: 'Kim's been pretty much doing it'\n\n'I've tried to help out when she has asked, but I haven't been over-involved. I did all the food and cake tasting which I really enjoyed, although I didn't think I was going to.\n\nHe added: 'It's a big day for Kim. Pretty much everything is taken care of now.

It's like - you do what you need to do to get what you want,' she said. \n\n'So if they need money they will commit fraudulent acts and steal, for example.'\n\nWhile other experts suggested to AWW that she could be suffering Munchhausen Syndrome, Lamble believes this isn't likely to be the case for Gibson. \n\nChanging times: 'In the past, a need for that love and attention may have been in less dangerous ways... but now technology has allowed it to get completely out of hand,' says Lamble\n\n'With Munchhausen, they normally don't just lie, they go much further to be sick.\n\n'While they definitely fake illness, they also self-harm and don't normally do it for money purposes, they do it for attention,' she said.\n\n'For example, they will go to lots of different doctors and shop around until someone believes their symptoms. They also might drink poison or swallow things or stab themselves, then ask, ""what's wrong with me?''\n\n'So I think in this particular case,  she's made up a story for fame, fortune, signing book deals - which suggests more narcissism and anti-socialism,' added Lamble.\n\nAnother common trait shared by narcissists is that sufferers are often very charismatic.\n\n'A lack or remorse definitely fits in... you do want you need to do to get what you want': Leading psychologist Jo Lamble says that Gibson's actions point to both a narcissism disorder and anti-social personality disorder\n\n'Narcissistic people will lie and build themselves up to be an amazing person full of grandiosity, wanting fame and fortune. They love to believe they are special and need all this admiration and attention,' the psychologist said.\n\nLamble says this can often be a sign of neglect. This fits with Gibson's account of a troubled childhood - she was quoted in the Women's Weekly saying she had to bring herself up - doing the dishes and cooking her own food from a very young age, for example.\n\nAccording to Lamble, the common signs of someone showing an anti-social personality disorder are... \n\n1. They deceive and lie\n\n2. They lack remorse\n\n3. They can be  impulsive and irresponsible\n\n4. They don't respect the law\n\n5. They don't mind if they hurt family and friends, anyone is open to being deceived\n\n6. They are very charming and charismatic\n\n7. They have a certain attractiveness and draw people in\n\n8. They show a real interest in people\n\n9. Passionate about things \n\n'Neglect can lead someone to develop really unhealthy strategies to seek the love and attention they missed out on,' says Lamble.\n\n'In the past, a need for love and attention may have emerged in less dangerous ways  - a lie here, a lie there - but now technology has allowed it to get completely out of hand.\n\n'Social media has become the perfect way to gain that, we know anyone is thrilled when they get new followers -  let alone hero worship, worldwide fans and book deals,' she said.\n\n'I worry about future generations with things like Instagram, Twitter, Facebook and people constantly needing excessive praise.' \n\nLamble says our social media culture is fuelling unhealthy expectations for young girls but also a way of accessing information that could be misleading.\n\n'Everyone laughs about Dr Google and how if you have some condition you should see an expert but that goes for all these self styled gurus in anything.\n\n'We might want to buy into a story, it's very appealing for people to love somebody who can turn something around and survive and particularly so if they are very marketable but any idolisation of someone isn't healthy.\n\n'With massive followings and a glamorous story, young minds will follow that and believe it. Our poor doctors must have people coming in every day and people saying this is what I'm doing and why. Let's look at the science,' she said. \n\n'They love to believe they are special': 'Narcissistic people will lie and build themselves up to be an amazing person full of grandiosity, wanting fame and fortune, says psychologist Jo Lamble (pictured left). She believes Belle Gibson (pictured right) may suffer from a narcissism disorder and anti-social personality disorder.\n\nLamble also believes that Gibson could struggle to change without help. \n\n'She might change her name and come up with some other scheme unless she shows genuine remorse, seeks help, and develops some insight. With what she is displaying, the prognosis is quite poor.'\n\nAccording to the interview, Gibson's new management will be organising for a psychologist to see her.","Wellness guru and app developer Belle Gibson lied about having cancer..

""None of my siblings helped me. I raised you and sent you to school. Without money I could not have gotten you an education.""\n\nA widow at just 21, Dahou was forced to fend for herself in Egypt's patriarchal south, where decades ago it was unheard of for women to earn their own living. Even in recent years, women make up barely 24% of Egypt's workforce, according to the World Bank.\n\n""It is considered wrong that I dressed as a man but no one can judge. Not you or anyone else. Only God can judge me,"" Dahou said, ""People talked but I said I decided to be a man so I can take care of my small daughter.""\n\nThe breadwinner worked as a brick maker for just 25 piasters, the equivalent of a few cents, until she saved up enough money to buy a shoeshine kit.  She found a place for her wooden box, painted with red hearts and the Egyptian flag, alongside the all-male shoe shiners of her community.\n\n""If it wasn't for my mother, I would have been on the streets"" Houda, her daughter, told TV host Mona al-Shazly through tears. ""Honestly I would have been in the streets. I did not find a home except with my mother. And even today my children rely on her.""\n\nThe years of sun and sand weathered and darkened Dahou's face and left her with a voice so deep and raspy she can easily be mistaken for a man. Her only child, Houda, eventually married and had two children of her own.\n\nThrough the years the one-time housewife dreamed of owning her own business one day, a small street stand to sell snacks and cigarettes.  After her interview on CBC television, the governor of Luxor province offered Dahou a kiosk and a cash advance. The maverick had one requirement- she would only agree to meet with the governor in male attire.\n\n""Even if I die, I will not take it off,"" Dahou said as she pulled on the male jalabiya in front of a TV camera, ""When I had to dress in a woman's jalabiya when I went to Cairo I felt suffocated. No, I thank God. I don't want anyone to look at me or look at my daughter.""\n\nNow the 65-year-old who earned respect as a man has gained praise as a woman. Egypt's President, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, crowned her as one of Egypt's ideal mothers in an official ceremony last month.\n\n""If I was really a man, I would not have done this,"" Dahou told her daughter, ""I would have gotten remarried. I would have left you who knows where. You would have been treated without dignity or left homeless. Thank God I was able to protect you.""","Sissa Abu Dahou recently was honored as one of Egypt's ideal mothers..

After all, this was to have been Kim's first official international trip since he came to power in 2011 following his father's death, and it would have provided a fascinating opportunity for the world to get a closer look at a young leader and a regime still largely shrouded in mystery.\n\nBut this week, Russia announced that the trip had been canceled, with Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov saying Thursday that Moscow was informed via diplomatic channels that the trip would not happen. He said that ""the decision is connected with North Korean domestic affairs.""\n\nWhat could have changed Kim's mind? It is practically impossible to answer the question with absolute certainty, but a possible explanation is that Kim may not be feeling completely secure in his position. And nervous dictators prefer to stay home.\n\nTrue, Kim runs one of the most brutally repressive regimes on Earth. And there is unceasing public praise for the younger 'Dear Leader,"" including frenzied eruptions of support. But these eruptions are carefully scripted, and those who have managed to flee the North confirm that in private, many are unhappy with the regime.\n\nPerhaps with the potential threats in mind, Kim feels the need to reassert his authority and keep his eye on the centers of power.\n\nIn 2013, Kim shocked the country and stunned outside observers when he ordered the killing of his uncle, Jang Song Thaek, who had stood by his side from the day his father died. Jang had mentored and guided the young Kim as he took the reins, but the once-powerful Jang was arrested by soldiers during a Politburo meeting who dragged him away in a chilling scene broadcast on national television.\n\nThe central news agency called Jang a ""traitor for all the ages,"" with vague accusations that he had behaved ""insolently."" More seriously, he was accused of ""counter-revolutionary factional acts in a bid to overthrow the leadership.""\n\nAnd just this week, and only a day before the Russians announced Kim's canceled travel plans, a South Korea lawmaker revealed that South Korea's National Intelligence Service had pieced together information suggesting that so far this year, Kim has ordered the execution of 15 senior government officials.\n\nAccording to South Korean legislator Shing Kyung-min, North Korea's vice chairman of the State Planning Commission, for example, was executed because he objected to plans to change the design of a new government hall from a rounded shape to one resembling a flower.\n\nSuch an explanation is bizarre. And in keeping with the odd behavior we have grown accustomed to hearing about from North Korea. But there may be more to this.\n\nKim -- who was still in his 20s when he took power and holds a host of titles, including Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army -- still finds it necessary to remind everyone at home that he is the one in charge.\n\nBut although there is something almost comical about the explanations offered up by North Korea for the actions of its regime, a nervous, unpredictable, inexperienced leader with access to nuclear weapons is far from a laughing matter.\n\nAs recently as 2013, North Korea conducted a nuclear test -- the country's third, and it has threatened to use them against South Korea, Japan and the United States. Meanwhile, it has threatened South Korea with ""final destruction,"" said it will turn the country's presidential office into a sea of fire, told Japan it would trigger a nuclear attack if Tokyo followed through on a warning to destroy any North Korean missiles fired in its direction, and declared the United States is seeking a war and that Pyongyang ""will be exercising our right to preemptive nuclear attacks.""\n\nSuch rhetoric is itself troubling. But experts have also warned this week that North Korea may have restarted its Yongbyon nuclear reactor, with the Institute for Science and International Security arguing that snow melting patterns in images of the plant suggest new activity at the plant.\n\nNorth Korea has been mostly out of the news in recent months, partly because so many other international crises have pushed it out of the headlines. But that doesn't mean tensions have eased. Just three weeks ago, Pyongyang fired missiles into the sea as U.S. Defense Secretary Ash Carter arrived on the Korean peninsula.\n\nAll this suggests that gauging the state of mind of the North Korean leader is no easy task. But if Kim raises the alarm about threats from the outside, we will know he is likely feeling insecure at home and may be trying to boost internal support. That would be a danger sign for the people of North Korea -- and a flashing red light for the rest of the world.\n\nRead CNN Opinion's Flipboard magazine.",Russia says Kim jong un has canceled trip to Moscow..

He later told colleagues that he administered CPR\n\nScott's father said of the incident: 'It would have never come to light [had video not emerged]. They would have swept it under the rug, like they did with many others.' \n\nSlager's former attorney had initially claimed that the officer fired on Scott during a struggle for his Taser and had felt threatened. \n\n'When confronted, Officer Slager reached for his Taser — as trained by the department — and then a struggle ensued,' David Aylor said. \n\n'The driver tried to overpower Officer Slager in an effort to take his Taser. [He] felt threatened and reached for his department-issued firearm and fired his weapon.'\n\nOn Wednesday North Charleston Mayor Keith Sumney refused to answer a question on Slager's fellow officers' culpability, saying it would be addressed in the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division [SLED] investigation.\n\nThere are also questions over discrepancies between responding officers' version of events in an internal incident report and what the witness video shows. \n\nIt is not known what accounts those officers gave to the subsequent SLED investigation. \n\nThe video of the shooting shows Officer Clarence Haberdasham was the first to arrive on scene as Scott lay handcuffed on the ground. \n\nAs Haberdasham arrives, Slager runs back to position where he fired the fatal shots and appears to retrieve a dark object - claimed to be his Taser - and places it next to Scott's body.\n\nHaberdasham dons a pair of blue gloves, checks Scott's pulse, goes through his pockets and speaks on his radio and then walks away.\n\nRadio records show that an officer reported that Scott had gunshot wounds to the chest and right side and was 'unresponsive'. He later added that the vicitm had wounds to the back. Both Slager and Haberdasham stand over Scott's body, which remains handcuffed and face down.\n\nThe same officer's account of events as reported in the NCPD incident report obtained by BuzzFeed is two sentences. The second reads: 'I attempted to render aid to the victim by applying pressure to the gunshot wounds and directing the best route for EMS and fire to get to the victim faster.' \n\nAftermath: Officer Slager is pictured standing over Walter Scott and feeling for a pulse after he put the man's fallen body in handcuffs. According to police reports, officers performed CPR on the 50-year-old father - but the cop was not filmed giving any medical assistance\n\n \n\nPOLICE VERSION \n\nPolice officer Michael Slager said in a statement earlier this week that his encounter with Walter Scott began at around 9.30am on Saturday.\n\nHe said he pulled Scott's Mercedes over as a routine traffic stop for a broken brake light.\n\nHe said Scott then ran away into a vacant grassy lot where, at some point during the chase, the victim confronts Slager.\n\nThe officer then tried to use his Taser to subdue Scott, but claims the suspect grabbed the stun gun during the struggle, according to the statement.\n\nAccording to police reports, Slager fired the stun gun, but it did not stop Scott.\n\nAt that point, the officer fired at Scott several times because he 'felt threatened,' Slager's statement said.\n\nHe added that his actions were in line with procedure.\n\nPolice then said Slager reported on his radio moments after the struggle: 'Shots fired and the subject is down. He took my Taser.'\n\nHis department said the officers then performed CPR and delivered first aid to the victim. \n\n WHAT THE VIDEO SHOWS\n\nSlager's account has been called into question after the video appears to show him shooting Scott in the back.\n\nThe footage begins in the vacant lot apparently moments after Slager fires his Taser.\n\nWires which administer the electrical current appear to be extending from Scott's body.\n\nAs Scott turns to run, Slager draws his pistol and, only when he is 15 to 20 feet away, starts to fire the first of the eight shots at his back.\n\nThe video shows Slager handcuffing Scott's lifeless body. \n\nFootage then appears to show Slager jogging back to the point where the Taser fell to the ground, bringing it over to Scott's body around 30 feet away and dropping it next to him. \n\nIt is only after two-and-a-half minutes that Slager is seen placing his hand on Scott's neck in an apparent attempt to check his pulse.\n\nA black colleague then arrives and puts on blue medical gloves before handling the body, but is not seen performing first aid.\n\nThey are joined by a third officer, who also does not appear to tend to the victim. \n\nThe report is signed off by Sergeant James Gann. He states: 'I arrived on scene and observed that Officer Haberdasham was administering first aid to the driver. I exited my vehicle and assisted Officer Haberdasham with first aid and CPR to the driver.' \n\nHe says they continued to give CPR until EMS arrived and Scott was pronounced dead. \n\nThere is no evidence in Feidin Santana's video that Scott received CPR. \n\nA second video of the scene shows two other police officers arriving at the scene and getting out a medical kit. But they do not give CPR. \n\nSix other officers' version of what happened after the shooting is recorded in the incident report. \n\nThey were: R. Terrell, J Bariss, M Cooper, R Killin, B Williams, and Sgt Webb. \n\nThey all say that they heard Slager's call for help and arrived at the scene later. \n\nGann says the crime scene was handed over to SLED, who then concluded their crime scene investigation that day. \n\nEdward Bryant III, president of the North Charleston NAACP, also told the Los Angeles Times that he suspects North Charleston cops have covered up other shootings. \n\nHe said; 'This incident fits a pattern of abuse that has gone on for years. There is a code of conduct to cover their behinds. We call it Code Blue.'\n\nMarc Moria, President of the president of the National Urban League, told the Washington Post: 'But for this video, this would have been another coverup, another fabrication, another lie told by a police officer when the police officer was clearly in the wrong.'\n\nThe discrepancies were also discussed on MSNBC's Morning Joe this morning. \n\nHost Joe Scarborough said: 'That cop is two feet away when he dropped the taser next to the dead body. I'm sorry, what cop is okay with that?'\n\nMika Brzezinski added: 'There should be more charges'  \n\nAfter Officer Michael Slager was charged with murder on Tuesday and terminated from the North Charleston Police on Wednesday, his department released his personnel file. \n\nSome 100 pages including his job application, training records, firearm test scores and work appraisals were published online. \n\nAmong the details were that Slager had graduated from Lenape High School in Medford, N.J, in 2001 and was a waiter at an Italian restaurant before he joined the U.S. Coast Guard in 2003. \n\nHe spent six years with the Coast Guard working as a mechanic and engineer and then became involved in security on board vessels. \n\nHe was hired by the North Charleston Police Department in December 2009 and attended the South Carolina Criminal Justice Academy for a nine-week training course. \n\nMajor Florence McCants told Yahoo News that Slager 'didn't create any issues nor was he an award winner in any of the categories'. \n\nSlager also took course in first-aid and use of a Taser, according to his personnel records.",Growing questions over the conduct of Michael Slager's fellow officers..

Some of his answers only fuelled the fire really. I'm hoping that that wasn't the whole point, as we've seen these sorts of situations engineered by agents before.\n\nThe interview has almost certainly changed the way the fans feel about him. There will be a lot of fans that are of the opinion: 'let him go'. Obviously, with the caveat that we get our money's worth!\n\nRaheem Sterling returns to Liverpool training after the international break and shakes hands with manager Brendan Rodgers\n\nSterling risked angering Liverpool fans after he said in an interview he was not ready to sign a contract\n\nSterling trains ahead of the weekend's game with Arsenal \n\nIt's always disappointing when a young player gets his head turned, but there's a sense of ungratefulness about the whole situation, considering how the club has nurtured him and paid him well throughout.\n\nPersonally, I think he has the potential to be worth so much more than the £100,000-a-week contract he's turned down.\n\nBut it's only that: potential. At present, he's arguably in the top five best young players in the world but, obviously at his age, he's also prone to bouts of inconsistency and prolonged poor form.\n\nHe hasn't been great recently and was awful against Man Utd.\n\nSterling has been linked with a move to Arsenal - the team he is preparing to face at the weekend \n\nRaheem Sterling played for England in the 4-0 Euro 2016 qualifier against Lithuania  \n\nAnd while I'd be willing to see the club give him £100k a week – possibly £120k a week - the club shouldn't do everything it can to keep him. Definitely not. Liverpool fans have a popular mantra: no player is bigger than the club.\n\nAdmittedly, we stretch the rules for truly great players (Suarez, a recent example) but Sterling is nowhere near. If he wants out, I'm sure the club will handle it the way they have before.\n\nFrustration over Sterling's situation has been building for a while, and many fans are now of the belief that if he wants to go he's welcome to.\n\nPersonally, I don't like players holding the club to ransom. He has as much chance of winning trophies here as he does anywhere (other than money-rich clubs such as Chelsea or Man City).\n\nSterling did not have his best game in a Liverpool shirt during the defeat at Manchester United\n\nLiverpool fans have a mantra that no player is bigger than the club\n\nIf Sterling was to move to Arsenal then it would not go down well with Liverpool fans \n\nBut if he does end up going, he's worth a lot more than many established players. His ability is so raw but he has almost limitless potential.\n\nAt the moment, we've seen it in fits and starts but even so, he's easily worth £25-30 million. If I was FSG, I'd hold any interested club to ransom, though – double it.\n\nBut a move to Arsenal wouldn't go down well. Perhaps better than if it was Chelsea or Manchester United, but honestly there's little Arsenal can offer that we can't.\n\nSure, they're more financially stable but what – in terms of trophies – do Arsenal have to show for the last 12 years?\n\nSterling speaks to the BBC and reveals he is not ready to sign a new contract\n\nI think we're somewhat ahead on that front. Much like Alexis Sanchez, any move to Arsenal will be more about location than anything else.\n\nPeople have drawn comparisons with when Suarez wanted to leave for Arsenal, but the situation is different.\n\nSuarez says he wanted Champions League football and we weren't offering that at that time. Not only that, but Suarez was an established top-class player at the time, one of the best in the world.\n\nSterling is purely potential and, given all the club have done for him (cliched, as that sounds), it makes little sense. If he's going to be nurtured into the world-class talent he can become, it won't happen at Arsenal.\n\nIt may not necessarily happen at Anfield either, but a manager like Brendan Rodgers will give him the best shot of improving to that level over the next two to three years.\n\nYou can read more from Live4Liverpool HERE and follow the Twitter account HERE","Raheem Sterling said he was not ready to sign a new Liverpool contract..

'If it was easy, you wouldn't lose 3-1 at home to Monaco. If he defends well he draws 0-0 against Monaco and wins in Monte Carlo. It's not easy to defend.'\n\nJose Mourinho hit back at Arsene Wenger during his pre-match press conference on Friday\n\nArsene Wenger (left) and Mourinho have over a decade of history in the Premier League \n\nArsene Wenger will be sick of the sight of Didier Drogba. He has scored 13 times for Chelsea against Arsenal, averaging a goal every 87 minutes.\n\nMonaco, ouch.\n\nMourinho is not afraid to hit where it hurts. Arsenal have been brilliant since the turn of the year, but they were downright awful at home to Monaco.\n\nThey conceded three and they crashed out of the Champions League. It was a blemish to support the theory that Arsenal are fine until the pressure is on.\n\nWhen Chelsea crashed out of Europe they were, as usual, snarling and disputing every decision.\n\n'Maybe you will discover the Chelsea team are completely offensive and we are defensive for 90 minutes,' said Wenger, resorting to sarcasm as he assessed the clash at the Emirates on Sunday.\n\n'Our job is to win football games and that's what they've done in recent games. What's important for me is to do what it takes to win the game. It's easy to defend, if we have to defend then we will defend.'\n\nIt is the issue at the heart of this ideological clash. On one side Wenger, committed to the romance of attractive football. On the other Mourinho, doing what it takes to win even if it proves ugly, stacking up the trophies. Beat Arsenal and Leicester, on Wednesday, and he will clinch the title.\n\nArsenal lost 3-1 to Monaco in the Champions League - a result which Mourinho mentioned to the media\n\nPrince Albert of Monaco celebrates with the away fans after the full-time whistle at the Emirates\n\nWenger looks dejected as he stands on the touchline during the Gunners' Champions League defeat\n\nThe challenge for Wenger is next season. Can he produce a team fit to fight for the title once again?\n\n'We have played amazingly well for most of the season,' said Mourinho. 'In the last period we have been more strategic and less artistic because we had injuries and suspensions and lost the balance of our team.\n\n'But we are having results. It is a great feeling to deal with the difficult moment in a strategic way. When you are lost at sea and you have no boat, you must survive. You build a raft.' Diego Costa's injuries and suspensions were Chelsea's shipwreck. Without his muscular spearhead, the balance was lost and it is three months since his team won by more than one goal.\n\nStill they win, taking six points from their last two games — against QPR and Manchester United — while recording a total of only three shots on target. They are, as Wenger says, efficient. 'We are top since day one,' said Mourinho. 'We are second in terms of goals scored. We are second best for goals conceded, the team with fewest defeats.\n\nChelsea forward Eden Hazard (second from left) scores against Manchester United last time out\n\nHazard scored the only goal of the game against United to take Chelsea a step closer to the league title\n\nA TV camera gets a close-up of the goalscorer as Hazard celebrates with Didier Drogba at Stamford Bridge\n\n'We have some of the best goals of the season, not individual action or shots like Charlie Adam's from midfield, but spectacular team goals.\n\n'So, if we win the Premier League, we did everything right. It will be a great achievement. Looking at where Chelsea were in the last four or five years, it means a lot.'\n\nIt will be the first title in five years at Stamford Bridge. Arsenal have not won it since 2004, the year of Wenger's Invincibles and the year Mourinho first swept into London claiming to be the Special One.\n\nSince then, two famous clubs have been soaked in the contrasting views of two men. Arsenal are Wenger, after more than 18 years of his leadership, and Chelsea have been Mourinho for more than a decade — even during his six-year absence.\n\nMourinho (right) and Wenger have had plenty of touchline battles during their managerial careers\n\nThe pair rarely miss the chance to damn with faint praise or hurl a snide remark across the capital\n\nArsenal's Emmanuel Eboue is restrained by Chelsea boss Mourinho during the 2007 League Cup final\n\nThey rarely miss the chance to damn with faint praise or hurl a snide remark across the capital.\n\nFor many years, Wenger pursued Chelsea for 'financial doping' and, more recently, their tactical style, while Mourinho gorged on Arsenal's nine years with neither a trophy nor a managerial change.\n\nMourinho has never lost to Wenger, a record which clearly eats away at the Frenchman, who exploded on the touchline at Stamford Bridge, in October, and shoved the Chelsea manager in the chest.\n\nThere has been no apology. 'No, but I don't need that,' shrugged Mourinho, who remains incredulous that Wenger was not disciplined by the FA. Does he feel it would have been different had the roles been reversed? 'I don't feel, I know,' he said.","Chelsea can secure the League title if they beat Arsenal and Leicester.. Jose Mourinho and Arsene Wenger have had a decade of touchline battles.. Mourinho has hit back at Wenger's 'defensive' jibes ahead of Sunday..

To be 'boyish' for longer, to be young girls,' he said, according to the BBC.\n\nBoys could also benefit from being taught separately. \n\nStatistics have shown that boys often lag behind girls at both GCSE and A-level and are much less likely to apply to university. \n\nAlun Jones, the first male president of the Girls' Schools Association, has previously called for teenage boys  to be taught in single sex classes in state schools. \n\nMr Jones, who is also a schools inspector, said: 'If you have a very bright, very driven, very focused, very articulate lady, which a lot of girls are, that intimidates a boy in the classroom, especially boys of average ability.\n\n'The result is that boys don't put their hands up to answer questions or they indulge in immature behaviour to avoid being shown up.

Pictured is an interior view of a Google self-driving car showing the video and the data the car uses to 'see' the road. Google is believed to be working on technology for self-driving cabs, but hasn't revealed details\n\nThe study, by Paris-based Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development  used data from Lisbon in Portugal.\n\nBy plugging the data into a computer model, they simulated how such self-driving, communal cabs would affect traffic. \n\nEven with only one passenger per ride and no complementary public transport, the number of cars still dropped by 77 per cent.\n\nThe authors said replacing personal cars with self-driving cabs would also free valuable real estate currently used for public parking - equivalent to over 200 football pitches in Lisbon's case.\n\nMajor technology firms are already banking on self-driving taxis to be the future of transportation.\n\nEven with only one passenger per ride and no complementary public transport, the number of cars still dropped by 77 per cent. In this image is one Google's autonomous vehicles pictured with Google Chairman Eric Schmidt (left) and  US Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx (right)\n\nLast year, for instance, ride-sharing service Uber said it could replace all of its drivers with autonomous vehicles.\n\nCEO Travis Kalanick admitted the technology would keep costs down, and these savings could then be passed on to its customers.\n\nCorey Clothier, who is co-ordinating the trials told DailyMail.com that an accident involved a driverless car is inevitable - although he added none have taken place in his pilots.\n\n'Systems will fail, people's judgements will fail,' he said. 'If someone jumps out from a blind spot from a vehicle, if it can't stop, it can't stop.'\n\nA recent report by the Institution of Engineering and Technology highlighted research that showed human drivers change their behaviour when using the same roads as autonomous cars.\n\nMotorists were found to copy the driving style of the computer controlled cars by leaving less space between them and the vehicle in front, but were less able to react quickly.\n\nHowever, many experts say that driverless cars could actually reduce the risk of accidents as computers are able to react a lot faster than humans. \n\nGoogle has also been teaching its vehicles to drive more safely by giving them instructions on 'defensive driving' styles.\n\nThey have also been experimenting with teaching the vehicles 'body language' to communicate with other drivers what its intentions are. \n\nSpeaking at the Code Conference in California, Kalanick said: 'The reason Uber could be expensive is because you're not just paying for the car - you're paying for the other dude in the car.\n\n'When there's no other dude in the car, the cost of taking an Uber anywhere becomes cheaper than owning a vehicle.'\n\nGoogle was an early backer of the San Francisco-based firm, investing $258 million (£170 million) in the controversial ride-sharing service through its venture capital arm in August 2013. \n\nBut last month unnamed source told Bloomberg that Google is preparing to offer its own taxi service, and it was likely to use its driverless cars. \n\nThe report said that Google had told Uber's board of this possibility, and executives had seen screenshots of what appears to be a Google ride-sharing app, currently being used by employees.\n\nWhile driverless taxis are still some way off from becoming a reality, a separate report last month found they could soon find their way into our airports and campuses.\n\nTen US cities will roll out automated vehicle pilot projects this year, with the first being unveiled in Tampa Bay, Florida in the spring.\n\nMeanwhile, trials will launch in another 12 to 20 US locations by the end of next year, which means driverless cars could be on the roads in up to 30 US cities by 2017.\n\nAs well as the US, the UK will also be trialing the vehicles in Greenwich as part of the $9 million project called Gateway, shuttling people to the O2 Arena.\n\nThe finding comes amid reports that companies such as Google and Uber are working on technology to develop driverless taxis \n\nSome will be on the roads where it's legal,' Corey Clothier, a strategist Comet LLC, who is running the trials told DailyMail.com.\n\nPassengers can set their destination on some of the vehicles by typing it into a map or using commands.\n\nA combination of radar, lasers gives the car a 360-degree 'view', with sensors linked to computer software able to 'see' and identify people, cars, road signs and markings and traffic lights.\n\n'It's interesting to see people's reactions', said Clothier. 'Very few are nervous, or noticeably nervous. \n\n'We've had interesting reactions from non-riders too. We were in the Silicon Valley and we had hundreds of people step in front of the vehicle to see what would happen.'\n\n'The vehicles stopped.

Set your location settings to off if you do not want people to be able to figure out where you and your children live. \n\nOnly share with people who care\n\nAsk yourself if all the people you're sharing your photos with really want to see them and will they protect them in a way you would.  \n\nExplore private social networks\n\nPrivate social networks offer a secure way to share the pictures of your children with your family and friends. \n\nDon't take any digital photos\n\nUltimately the only way to be 100 per cent sure that you don't  have a digital footprint is not to have any digital photos taken but this isn't a road the vast majority of people want to go down. \n\n'In a lot of cases it probably is fine but when you're giving away exactly where your family life is taking place, there's a risk and it's probably more sensible not to do it.\n\n'People have started to be less self-aware and when everything happens they put it online. What they don't think about is who they're sharing it with.'\n\nWhile Ms Kurtini said that she understands why people can get fed up of people oversharing their kids' lives on social media sites, she was disturbed at the letter Ms Ruthven received from her so-called friends. \n\n'Everyone came out in support of her which they should have done because bullying shouldn't be tolerated and that letter was horrific,' she said. \n\nToo many posts: Jade Ruthven, 33, pictured with Addison, has been sharing endless pictures and statuses about her baby daughter on Facebook\n\n'No one has come out and said that the limit is one baby photo a week or one a month, but everyone seems to know when someone has stepped over the mark.'\n\nThe entrepreneur said it's hard for people to know where the line stops when it comes to posting personal details online. \n\nWhile a person may thrive off 'checking in' at the city's fanciest restaurant or showing friends what they're missing at the local pub, they can't treat their children's photos in the same way and should not look for the same social validation. \n\n'One of the scary things about social media is how it makes you check yourself the whole time and second guess whether people will receive it well and it can make new mums quite anxious,' Ms Kurtini said. \n\nHarsh words: The letter was sent to an 'baby spamming' mother after the author got fed up with the amount of pictures and statuses she was writing on Facebook about her child - and it has now been shared worldwide\n\n'As soon as your friends like it you're just putting it into a new feed and it's not clear where they're going.' \n\nMs Kurtini, who is the co-founder of Tinybeans, a private social media network for families said that although parents are worried about what the dangers of sharing on social media are, they choose to ignore the warnings. \n\nIn a recent survey of social media awareness, conducted by the University of Michigan, over 74 per cent of respondents claimed they had doubts about posting baby images on the web, however they followed the crowd and did it anyway.\n\nWorryingly, 51 per cent of parents offer up personal information alongside their photos that could identify a child's location and 27 per cent have shared inappropriate pictures of their baby. \n\nThey also found that more than half of mothers and one-third of fathers discuss child health and parenting on social media - and nearly three quarters of parents saying social media makes them feel less alone.\n\n'A thing we always say is to share with those who care and don't waste your precious family moments on people who don't want to see them,' she said. \n\nSocial validation: Nearly 70 percent of parents said they use social media to get advice from other more experienced parents and 62 % said it helped them worry less\n\n'The people I share with would never share them on and would protect them as much as I would.\n\nMs Kurtini believes the message has yet to sink in with parents who continually post inappropriate snaps on Instagram, Twitter and Facebook and even tag their location in the photos. \n\nMs Kurtini believes enabling the geographical location to appear on the picture is the most worrying trend of them all. \n\nA recent study found when sharing parenting advice on social media, common topics included :\n\nGetting kids to sleep (28%)\n\nNutrition and eating tips (26%)\n\nDiscipline (19%)\n\nDaycare/preschool (17%) \n\nBehaviour problems (13%)\n\n'The scary thing is that they don't know it's happening,' she said. \n\n'I know my privacy setting so I know that level of comfort with what I'm going to share but it looks like people don't.  \n\nEspecially on photo-sharing site Instagram, doting parents are sometimes inadvertently declaring their whereabouts and over time it can become clear exactly where they live. \n\nMs Kurtini said she has spoken to mummy bloggers and celebrities who are horrified to learn that their photos can be tracked back to their home address just by the switch of one button. \n\n'If you leave your location settings on, there's a location tag and you can hit it and the majority of people add their photos at home so you can pretty much guess where they live,' she said. \n\n'It terrifies me.\n\n'I keep seeing people doing it and I want to email them saying stop it, especially high profile people.'\n\nStories of oversharing gone wrong have been rampant in the news, with one of the most extreme examples including a phenomenon called 'digital kidnapping' reported on earlier this year.\n\nParents were shocked to learn that strangers were 'stealing' their kids' online photos and re-sharing them as if the children were their own.\n\nSand selfie: Despite parents being concerned over their privacy settings on social media sites, they continue to post photos online, sometimes giving away their geographical location \n\nIn other cases, children's photos have become the target of cruel jokes and cyber bullying. \n\nAmong the most notorious cases in recent years was that of a Facebook group that made fun of 'ugly' babies.\n\n'Many people are often lulled into a false sense of security thanks to the familiarity of social media and don't realise that the images or stories they post of their children may in fact be shared with a broader audience,' Ms Kurtini said. \n\n'Parents need to approach their child's digital footprint mindfully.'\n\nThe best way to do this is to know your privacy settings inside out. \n\nIn many instances, it can take only a matter of mere seconds to deduce the road someone lives on from their social media post. \n\nOther precautions to take are to only share your snaps with people you trust and use a personal, private social media network.", There has been a rise in 'sharenting' -

Kelly Ort initially told CNN the incident occurred just before 4 a.m. at 1OAK, a club in New York's Chelsea neighborhood known to draw celebrities among its clientele, the club later told CNN that the stabbing occurred in front of the Fulton Houses project down the street.\n\n""1OAK staff was unaware of the incident when it happened, as it occurred beyond their view in a different location. However, 1OAK's team assisted Mr. Copeland to their fullest capabilities, and called for help as soon as he was seen walking back towards the venue,"" the statement said.\n\nThe statement continued, ""A review of the video footage seems to reveal the incident did not originate from the venue or its immediate surroundings that are under 1OAK supervision.""\n\nCopeland and a female companion, Katrine Saltara, were in the club for about 10 minutes before leaving and walking down the street toward Fulton Houses, where their car was parked, said a 1OAK spokesperson. The spokesperson gave CNN additional details on condition of anonymity because 1OAK's legal team had approved only the club's official statement.\n\nThe suspect, who the spokesperson said never entered 1OAK, stabbed Copeland and Saltara in front of Fulton Houses, and according to the club's statement, ""Mr. Copeland's driver sprang to accost and detain the apparent perpetrator and that individual is now in police custody.""\n\nCharges against the suspect are pending, and his name will be released once charges are filed, Ort said.\n\nCopeland and Saltara tried to make their way back to the club to seek help from the 20 or so security personnel on hand, leaving a ""bloody trail of handprints"" between the site of the stabbing and the club, the spokesperson said. Copeland ""almost landed right next to the club,"" the spokesperson said, adding that surveillance footage will not show the actual stabbing because it occurred too far away from the club.\n\nThe club shut down immediately after the incident, the spokesperson said.\n\nA male and two females were taken to area hospitals, Ort said. A knife was recovered, a suspect was arrested and two individuals not involved in the dispute -- the Hawks' Pero Antic, 32, and Thabo Sefolosha, 30 -- were arrested on charges of obstructing governmental administration and disorderly conduct, she said.\n\nSefolosha faces an additional charge of resisting arrest, Ort said.\n\nWord of the stabbing quickly spread through the club, reaching Antic and Sefolosha, who went outside to check on their friend, Copeland, the 1OAK spokesperson said. At one point, the two began pushing their way through a crowd that had gathered around the scene, leading to their arrests, the spokesperson said.\n\n""We will contest these charges and look forward to communicating the facts of the situation at the appropriate time,"" the players said in a joint statement released by the team. ""We apologize to our respective families, teammates, and the Hawks' organization for any negative attention this incident has brought upon them.""\n\nThe Hawks are in New York for a Wednesday night game against the Brooklyn Nets. Neither player will be in uniform, the team said.\n\nPolice released little information Wednesday, but local media identified the injured man as Copeland, 31, who is from Orange, New Jersey.\n\nThe Pacers released a statement saying Copeland suffered a knife wound to his left elbow and abdomen, and he's in stable condition at a New York hospital.\n\n""We are aware that Chris Copeland was injured early this morning in New York City. We are still gathering information and will update when we know more. Our thoughts are with Chris and those injured,"" Larry Bird, the Pacers' president of basketball operations, said in a statement.\n\nCopeland's agent, John Spencer, issued a statement saying, ""We're concerned about the safety of Chris and Katrine. We don't have any details at this particular time. All we can do is pray and wait.""\n\nThe NBA and the Hawks front office said they were looking into the incident.\n\n""We are aware of the situation involving Pero Antic and Thabo Sefolosha this morning. We are in the process of gathering more information and will have further comment at the appropriate time,"" Hawks spokesman Garin Narain said in an email.\n\nCopeland's Pacers are slated to play the New York Knicks on Wednesday night.\n\nThe pair apparently had only recently arrived in New York prior to their arrests, as both were on the court for the Hawks' 96-69 win over the Phoenix Suns in Atlanta on Tuesday night. Antic played 12 minutes, and Sefolosha played 20. The game ended around 10 p.m.\n\nCopeland, a former Knick, was near the nightclub with Saltara when a 22-year-old Brooklyn man approached them, police told CNN affiliate WABC.\n\nThere was some sort of dispute before the suspect stabbed the 6-foot-8-inch Copeland in the abdomen, slashed Saltara and then slashed another woman, the station reported.\n\nSaltara suffered cuts to her arm, breast and buttock, and the other woman suffered a slash to her stomach, CNN affiliate WCBS reported. While WCBS reported that the second woman was 53 years old, WABC reported she was 23.\n\nImages published in the New York Daily News showed a considerable amount of blood on the sidewalk and a white sports coupe, roped off with police tape, with several streaks of blood on its driver's side.\n\nAntic and Sefolosha interfered with officers trying to establish a crime scene, and one of the Hawks pushed a police officer, WABC reported.\n\nThe Hawks are preparing for a historic playoff run after clinching the No. 1 seed in the NBA's Eastern Conference. Tuesday's win over the Suns marked a franchise-best 58 wins in a season for the club. The Pacers sit in the conference's 10th spot but are only one game out of playoff contention.\n\nCNN's Laura Ly, Jason Durand and Jill Martin contributed to this report."," Hawks say neither Thabo Sefolosha nor Pero Antic will play Wednesday against Brooklyn.

To start, protesters say they're looking for answers about what happened to Freddie Gray, and why.\n\nBut it seems like the questions in the controversial case just keep growing.\n\nProtesters rallied at Baltimore City Hall on Thursday, and another march is planned for Saturday. Here's a look at key issues protesters are asking about:\n\nPolice say when Gray saw police on April 12, he started running. Within minutes, they caught up with him and arrested him after finding a knife in his pocket.\n\nProtesters have echoed the claims of the Gray family's attorney, who argues that police didn't have any probable cause to pursue him, but chased him for ""running while black.""\n\nBaltimore Police union attorney Michael Davey told reporters Wednesday that officers had every right to chase Gray.\n\n""There is a Supreme Court case that states that if you are in a high-crime area, and you flee from the police unprovoked, the police have the legal ability to pursue you, and that's what they did,"" he said. ""In this type of an incident, you do not need probable cause to arrest. You just need a reasonable suspicion to make the stop.""\n\nAn autopsy says Gray died from a severe spinal cord injury. His family says his voice box was crushed and his neck snapped before he slipped into a coma and later died.\n\nPolice say they spotted Gray, gave chase, caught him, cuffed him and requested a ""wagon"" to transport him in less than four minutes.\n\nThe transport van left with Gray about 11 minutes afterward, police said, and another 30 minutes passed before ""units request paramedics to the Western District to transport the suspect to an area hospital.""\n\nProtesters want to know exactly what happened in those 30 minutes, and say it's clear police used too much force when Gray was in their custody.\n\nInvestigators still haven't said what happened inside the van.\n\nUnion officials from the Fraternal Order of Police Lodge 3 say something happened inside the vehicle, but they don't know what.\n\nBaltimore Police Commissioner Anthony Batts told CNN affiliate WJZ that another prisoner inside the van said he didn't see any harm done to Gray.\n\n""What he has said is that he heard Freddie thrashing about,"" Batts said. ""The driver didn't drive erratically, wasn't slamming on breaks, wasn't turning corners fast or in an irrational way.""\n\nFive of the six officers involved in Gray's arrest have provided statements to investigators, the Baltimore Police Department said Wednesday.\n\n""They have completely cooperated with the investigation from Day 1,"" Davey told reporters.\n\nBut details of what the officers said haven't been released yet by authorities.\n\nNeither have the officers' personnel records or photos. Police say doing that would violate the law.\n\nThe lack of details a week and a half after the incident is fueling cries from the public, and the lawmakers who represent them. Protesters say police should be releasing what they know now.\n\nBaltimore Police officials say they're being as transparent as they can about the case while their criminal investigation is ongoing. And they say they plan to hand over details from the investigation to the State Attorney's Office next week.\n\nSome protesters say the officers should be charged with murder for Gray's death. Officials say an investigation is ongoing, and all  the officers involved have been suspended with pay. At this point, it isn't clear whether any charges will be filed.\n\nThe U.S. Justice Department is also investigating the case.\n\nThe police union said it's 100% behind the officers and compared protesters to a lynch mob, accusing them of calling for charges against officers without knowing the facts of the case or giving them a day in court.\n\n""There is, at this time, no indication of any criminal activity whatsoever,"" the union's statement said, ""but our support will not waiver for any reason.""\n\nGray's case is getting a lot of attention. But protest organizers say it's emblematic of a broader problem.\n\nSome protesters say it's not the only time they've seen police brutality on the streets of their city.\n\nLong before they took to the streets to demonstrate over Gray's death, some of them had already been at city hall, voicing their concerns over other cases.\n\n""Right now there's a lot of mistrust. They feel it's us versus them,"" Baltimore City Council President Jack Young said. ""It should not be that way and it needs to be fixed.""\n\nAccording to the Baltimore Sun, the city has paid more than $5.7 million since 2011 for more than 100 cases involving allegations of police wrongdoing.\n\nPolice didn't admit fault in any of the cases. The police union said in a statement on Wednesday that the reason for the settlements was simple: City officials believe lawsuits are too costly.\n\n""Let us be clear, we completely disagree with this policy, as many of these cases are settled without concern for the facts but, rather, to avoid the high cost of defending a potential lawsuit. We believe that these cases should be decided in court where proper time and attention can be given,"" the union said. ""The ease of settlement, and substantial award amount, has led to the unjustified perception of an increase in brutality complaints.""\n\nCNN's Dana Ford, Eliott C.

For both groups, the question touches as much on national identity as on historical facts.\n\nSome Armenians feel their nationhood cannot be fully recognized unless the truth of what happened to their forebears is acknowledged. Some Turks still view the Armenians as having been a threat to the Ottoman Empire in a time of war, and say many people of various ethnicities -- including Turks -- were killed in the chaos of war.\n\nIn addition, some Turkish leaders fear that acknowledgment of a genocide could lead to demands for huge reparations.\n\nSo, what do we know about happened in those fateful days? Here are some answers:\n\nThe Ottoman Turks, having recently entered World War I on the side of Germany and the Austro-Hungarian Empire, were worried that Armenians living in the Ottoman Empire would offer wartime assistance to Russia. Russia had long coveted control of Constantinople (now Istanbul), which controlled access to the Black Sea -- and therefore access to Russia's only year-round seaports.\n\nMany historians agree that the number was about 2 million. However, victims of the mass killings also included some of the 1.8 million Armenians living in the Caucasus under Russian rule, some of whom were massacred by Ottoman forces in 1918 as they marched through East Armenia and Azerbaijan.\n\nBy 1914, Ottoman authorities were already portraying Armenians as a threat to the empire's security. Then, on the night of April 23-24, 1915, the authorities in Constantinople, the empire's capital, rounded up about 250 Armenian intellectuals and community leaders. Many of them ended up deported or assassinated.\n\nApril 24, known as Red Sunday, is commemorated as Genocide Remembrance Day by Armenians around the world. Friday is the 100th anniversary of that day.\n\nThis is a major point of contention. Estimates range from 300,000 to 2 million deaths between 1914 and 1923, with not all of the victims in the Ottoman Empire. But most estimates -- including one of 800,000 between 1915 and 1918, made by Ottoman authorities themselves -- fall between 600,000 and 1.5 million.\n\nWhether due to killings or forced deportation, the number of Armenians living in Turkey fell from 2 million in 1914 to under 400,000 by 1922.\n\nAlmost any way one can imagine.\n\nWhile the  death toll is in dispute, photographs from the era document some mass killings. Some show Ottoman soldiers posing with severed heads, others with them standing amid skulls in the dirt.\n\nThe victims are reported to have died in mass burnings and by drowning, torture, gas, poison, disease and starvation. Children were reported to have been loaded into boats, taken out to sea and thrown overboard. Rape, too, was frequently reported.\n\nIn addition, according to the website armenian-genocide.org, ""The great bulk of the Armenian population was forcibly removed from Armenia and Anatolia to Syria, where the vast majority was sent into the desert to die of thirst and hunger.""\n\nNo. Genocide was not even a word at the time, much less a legally defined crime.\n\nThe word ""genocide"" was invented in 1944 by a Polish lawyer named Raphael Lemkin to describe the Nazis' systematic attempt to eradicate Jews from Europe. He formed the word by combining the Greek word for race with the Latin word for killing.\n\nGenocide became a crime in 1948, when the United Nations approved the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide. The definition included acts meant ""to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group.""\n\nArmenia, the Vatican, the European Parliament, France, Russia and Canada. Germany is expected to join that group on Friday, the 100th anniversary of the start of the killings.\n\nTurkey, the United States, the European Commission, the United Kingdom and the United Nations.\n\nA U.N. subcommittee called the killings genocide in 1985, but current U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon declines to use the word.\n\nAlso, a year ago, on the eve of the 99th anniversary of Red Sunday, then-Turkish Prime Minister (now-President) Recep Tayyip Erdogan offered condolences for the mass killings, which he said had ""inhumane consequences."" While Turkey vehemently continues to reject the word ""genocide,"" his remarks went further than those of any previous Turkish leader in acknowledging the suffering of Armenians."," The 100th anniversary of the start of the mass killings will be commemorated Friday. Turkey and others reject the use of the word ""genocide"" Most estimates of the deaths fall between 600,000 and 1.5 million.","[""The summary doesn't say what incident has reached its 100th anniversary.

That is when it becomes real. The second act of Tony McCoy's life. \n\nOn Saturday he will dismount from the bay gelding Box Office after the 4.25pm at Sandown Park – the Bet365 Handicap Hurdle – and it will begin. Perhaps it will not quite sink in, at first, amid the cheers and roars, the hoopla and a presentation from Ian Wright, an Arsenal hero, as befits McCoy's club allegiance.\n\nYet the following morning, when McCoy awakes an ex-jockey, he will understand there are no more competitive rides, no more races, no more Cheltenhams or Aintrees or even modest little handicap hurdles to separate him from the field. Just entries in record books and the fact he will never have to put his hand in his pocket at any racetrack in Britain or Ireland to remind him of what was.\n\nAP McCoy will race at Sandown on Saturday for the last time before he retires after a successful career\n\nTo date, McCoy has 4,357 winning memories. Eddie Arcaro had 4,779, including five Kentucky Derbys. He was known as The Master in American racing, comparable in his field to baseball legend Joe DiMaggio and golf's Jack Nicklaus. 'I liked being a celebrity, if I'm being honest,' Arcaro said. 'When a jockey retires he becomes just another little man.' Arcaro was retired 36 years before succumbing to liver cancer in 1997.\n\nIt cannot be said that McCoy has courted celebrity, or that he will ever be regarded as a little man by racegoers, yet as he scurries to his new life, minus its thrills, spills and the snap of broken bones, one cannot help but ask: why? To be a jockey is to live a life of denial, early nights, early mornings, restraint at the dinner table, water at the bar, long, hot baths to sweat out the weight that, in McCoy's case, lowered his sperm count. His children were born through IVF treatment. \n\nYet not one of McCoy's thoughts on retiring has centred greatly on the inconveniences or even the pain of injury. He doesn't now talk excitedly of lavish lunches or late nights, of never having to look at a fractured vertebrae via x-ray; there is no hint of the social whirl experienced by Sir Alex Ferguson on stepping down at Manchester United. McCoy will host a party at home on Sunday for family, friends and his closest racing colleagues, and the next day travel to the Punchestown festival with JP McManus, as a spectator.\n\nThe rest of his retirement talk amounts to wishful thinking. McCoy simply reiterates he would still like to be riding. If he could ride in disguise for another three years he would do just that.\n\nMcCoy (left) and wife Chanelle will host a party at home on Sunday for family and friends\n\nAnd why would he need a mask? That is the puzzle of McCoy's decision: the fear that appears to be at the heart of it. He is genuinely, unfathomably, unnerved by the thought of staying too long, of not going out a winner. True, Brian Clough was relegated in his final season at Nottingham Forest, Sugar Ray Leonard's last comeback of four ended in an early stoppage, Paul Gascoigne travelled to pitifully obscure outposts trying to cling on to what remained of his professional career. Yet, another year of McCoy? Another year of the man who currently leads the Jump Jockeys Championship by an insurmountable margin? Random misfortune aside, we know full well what would happen if he stayed on another year. He would be champion jockey a 21st time.\n\nTo put this view into perspective, the gap between McCoy and Tom Scudamore, who is in second place in the jockey's table, is 82 wins, while the gap between Scudamore and third-placed Richard Johnson is two. Between Johnson and Sam Twiston-Davies it is four, between Twiston-Davies and Brian Hughes, 37. There is no margin anywhere comparable to the distance McCoy and the rest. There is no-one on his shoulder, no-one breathing down his neck, no-one gaining on him up the hill. What worries him – that people may think he is not the rider of old – is several years away, at least. Hence his fantasy of racing in disguise, without the burden of history. 'I'd ride forever if I could,' he explained.\n\nFerguson got out of Manchester United at the right time. He could not have foreseen the calamitous fall of David Moyes' first season, but he must have had an inkling that his team might find it hard to retain their title. A businessman, too, Ferguson would have known the commercial cache in leaving a winner – the opportunities in the world of publishing, or at Harvard and beyond. Here was his chance – and who knows when the conditions would be right again? A man of many interests, and past retirement age, he stood down and prepared to enjoy life. It was absolutely the right thing to do.\n\nMcCoy is unnerved by the thought of staying too long, of not going out a winner\n\nYet McCoy's farewell is almost troubling. 'When he retired, they should have shot him,' said Jack Charlton of his brother, Bobby. 'I've never seen anybody so unhappy.' \n\nSir Bobby has, thankfully, since made the second life all great sportsmen crave, as an ambassador for Manchester United and the Football Association, and a voice of reason within the boardroom at Old Trafford. \n\nMcCoy, almost certainly, will find a berth in racing where his expertise will be valued, no doubt with JP McManus. Yet it still won't be Fakenham on a wet Thursday – it won't be the Weatherbys Novice Hurdle at Towcester, in which McCoy piloted his 4,000th winner, Mountain Tunes.\n\nFor an athlete at the top as McCoy has been for so long, nothing can quite compare to the thrill of competition. For McCoy, any competition. The sheer number of times he took a race on sets him apart. In 2001-02, he rode over 1,000 times in Britain alone and since Richard Dunwoody claimed 160 winners to be crowned champion jump jockey in 1994-95, McCoy has surpassed that total in each of his 20 seasons. There will never be another like him – a fact he wanted to make sure of before retiring. It was important he would go to his grave unmatched.\n\nBrian Clough was relegated in his final season as manager at Nottingham Forest\n\nYet it is that determination, the desire for the victory no matter how small, that cannot be replicated in retirement. Gary Neville is very serious about his media work and won a broadcast award given by the Royal Television Society in March. His bosses at Sky wanted him to make a fuss about it. He refused. He wouldn't even recognise the news on his Twitter page. It was clear he didn't feel this achievement compared to those in his playing career. \n\nThen last week, when Salford City – the club he owns along with other members of the Class of 92 – won Northern Premier League Division One North, Neville was all over it. Whatever McCoy's place in the world from here, it cannot compare to the thrill of the chase.\n\nThat is why punters loved him, why his farewell at Sandown has long been a sell-out. This is a jockey who – on at least two occasions – rode winners that had drifted to 999-1 on Betfair at the midway stage. He was unseated by Family Business at Southwell in 2002 but kept watching the race and, on seeing the other four competitors variously fall or retire, remounted and won. Two years later, on the aptly named Mini Sensation at Exeter, he almost lost touch with the field with a circuit to go, before hitting the front 50 yards out. Mini Sensation had recorded eight straight losses going into that race.\n\nPaul Gascoigne (left) travelled to pitifully obscure outposts in the twilight of his career\n\nMcCoy's wife, Chanelle, will be pleased her husband no longer risks adding to a roll call of injuries that make the longevity of his time at the top all the more remarkable – and McCoy's father says he no longer enjoys watching him race. Maybe, deep down, even McCoy himself wondered how long he could continue to dodge the big one – the fall that might challenge his champion status.\n\n'One minute you're a world-class athlete, walking down the road, holding your head up, feeling bullet-proof,' said Billy Schwer, former IBO light-welterweight champion, now retired. 'You're Billy the Boxer. Then, in an instant, just Billy.'\n\nMcCoy has been trying to prepare himself for that moment all week. He turned down rides at Perth to give him the feel of spare time before sundown at Sandown. He is not looking forward to the weekend after, when he feels it will truly hit home. 'A lot of people wanted me to go to Perth,' McCoy said, 'but if I went to Perth I could think 'why not do one more week at Punchestown?' A lot of days I wish I wasn't doing it, that I hadn't said it. But I'm not changing my mind. I'm too stubborn for that.'\n\nLegendary manager Sir Alex Ferguson got out of Manchester United at the right time\n\nHe leaves having transformed his sport, having helped create four-day festivals that capture the imagination like at no time in history. He leaves having dominated for 20 years – a feat unparalleled, setting records that will not be so much as glimpsed at a distance, let alone challenged in his lifetime. And he leaves sounding every bit as certain as Green Bay Packers quarterback Brett Favre did in 2008, bringing the curtain down on a career of similar achievement.\n\n'I've given everything I can possibly give to this organisation,' Favre said. 'I don't think I have anything left to give. It's over. As hard as it is for me to say, it's over. I will wonder if I made the wrong decision. I'm sure on Sundays I will say I could be doing that or I should be doing that. But all good things must come to an end.'\n\nThe world agreed, and wished him well. The next year, he was back."," AP McCoy finished well ahead of rivals in Jump Jockeys Championship. There is no-one on his shoulder, no-one breathing down his neck .

I spoke to Jack first thing this morning as he came in, I explained to him his behaviour can't be tolerated by the football club.\n\n'He did not come in here with the ""I'm only young, I'm allowed to get away with it"" attitude. He was very ashamed and does not like the bad publicity.

He was given his first Premier League start on April 7 and has been integral to his side's success in the past three games.\n\nThe PFA have noticed a growing trend in the recreational use of nitrous oxide, and will look to adapt their extensive tutoring programmes on substance abuse. John Bramhall, PFA deputy chief executive, said: 'We're working with Sporting Chance, delivering the message, and it's a continuing process. It will change as different issues come into focus.'\n\nThe selfie, which shows Grealish and a friend, was taken in a hotel room after a night out, according to The Sun. Sherwood hopes Grealish can learn a lesson, not only about his choices but how such information can come into public knowledge.\n\n'He's hurting but he needs to stop hurting,' said Sherwood.

If you're a professional footballer you want to be noticed.\n\nEmre Can of Liverpool tries to tackle Grealish during their FA Cup tie with Aston Villa at Wembley\n\n'But he needs to get on the other side of the paper. I want him to forget about this by Saturday. I don't want him to dwell on it. It only really affects me if I let it affect him on the pitch.\n\n'As I said about Raheem last week, he's a young man. Jack was even younger a year earlier when the picture was taken. But it doesn't matter how young he is, he is now in a responsible position as a professional footballer, he's got to make sure it won't happen again; he's assured me it won't.\n\n'I'm not worried. To be honest there is only one form of discipline, that's self-discipline, that's what really matters. Jack has to take that on board now. This is an eye-opener for him, he has to realise he has to be very careful who he can trust out there.\n\n'I think he's a fantastic talent, he's willing to work hard at it, he will be a big player for the future of Aston Villa football club.'\n\nGrealish, who presented an award at his cousin's Under 12s team on Tuesday, has thrived on the pitch under the responsibility handed to him by Sherwood.\n\n'The circumstances probably dictated that I thought, ""Why not?

His death from a severe spinal chord injury sparked widespread outrage toward the Baltimore Police Department.\n\nGray's death in custody is the latest in a string of high profile deaths involving African-Americans and law enforcement.\n\nMany have demanded answers about what happened to Gray and his funeral drew civil rights leaders, politicians, and relatives of others who died in police custody.\n\nDemocratic Congressman Elijah Cummings of Maryland spoke at the funeral: ""To mother Gloria and to the entire family, I want you to know we stand with you during this difficult time.""\n\nCummings said he ""looked at the cameras"" and reflected on the great amount of attention Gray was receiving in death: ""Did anybody recognize Freddie Gray when he was alive?"" he asked.\n\nCummings said that Gray joined the church in 2001. He was in youth choir and was a junior usher. ""He loved church,"" Cummings said.\n\nGray also played football. ""Did you see him?"" the representative asked.\n\n""There are those who will tell you don't cry. I'm not going to say that,"" Cummings said.\n\nGray also had a history of run-ins with the law. According to court documents CNN obtained, there were more than 20 criminal court cases in Maryland against Gray, and five of those cases were still active at the time of his death. The cases involve mostly drug-related charges, but there are charges from March for second-degree assault and destruction of property. Gray was due in court on a possession charge on April 24.\n\nHe had been in and out of prison since 2009 for various drug cases, according to the Maryland Department of Corrections.\n\nFamilies United for Justice was also at the funeral. The group includes relatives of Eric Garner, who died last July after a New York City police officer put him in a chokehold. Protests erupted after a grand jury declined to indict that officer.\n\nOther members of the group include relatives of Amadou Diallo, who was fatally shot by New York police officers, and Alberta Spruill, who died of a heart attack after police threw a stun grenade into her apartment during a botched raid.\n\nThe White House sent Cabinet Secretary Broderick Johnson, chair of the Obama administration's My Brother's Keeper Task Force; Heather Foster, an adviser in the White House Office of Public Engagement; and Elias Alcantara from the Office of Intergovernmental Affairs.\n\nExactly what happened to Gray remains a mystery. His family said his voice box was crushed and his neck snapped before he slipped into a coma and died.\n\nNews of Gray's smashed upper spine and the delay in getting him medical care has triggered outrage across the country.\n\nHundreds of protesters peacefully rallied on the streets of Baltimore on Saturday against the alleged police role in Gray's death. A small group turned violent.\n\nAbout a dozen young men smashed police vehicles with garbage cans, climbed on top of the cars and stomped on them.\n\nSome hurled water bottles and other objects at police.\n\nOthers funneled their anger toward local businesses, looting or damaging a 7-Eleven, a Michael Kors store and a Subway restaurant.\n\nBaltimore police arrested 35 people, including four juveniles. Six officers suffered minor injuries during the chaos, which ended a week of civil and peaceful protests.\n\nGray's twin sister deplored the violence.\n\n""My family wants to say, 'Can y'all please, please stop the violence,' "" Fredericka Gray said Saturday night. ""Freddie Gray would not want this.""\n\nBaltimore City Paper said its photo editor, J.M. Giordano, was tackled and beaten by police while covering the protests.\n\nThe paper said Giordano was standing near protesters when someone threw a rock at police. Officers responded, and Giordano was unable to get out of the way.\n\n""They just swarmed over me,"" he said. ""I got hit. My head hit the ground. They were hitting me, then someone pulled me out.""\n\nThe incident was caught on video, which Baltimore City Paper posted online.\n\nAnd Reuters photographer Sait Serkan Gurbuz said Baltimore police detained him Saturday night.\n\nOfficers called the detention of the two journalists inadvertent.\n\n""One journalist (Gurbuz) was released with a criminal citation, which is being recalled,"" police said in a statement. ""One journalist (Giordano) was released without any charges.""\n\nCell phone video of Gray's arrest shows him screaming and being dragged, with some witnesses saying he looked like his leg was injured.\n\nBaltimore Police Commissioner Anthony Batts said he was appalled that Gray did not receive proper care immediately. He also said officers should have given Gray timely medical care ""multiple times"" -- such as at the site of the arrest and at other times during his transport to the police station.\n\nBatts also said there are no excuses for the fact that Gray was not buckled into the transport van.\n\nBut Baltimore's Fraternal Order of Police Lodge 3 shot back: ""These comments appear to be politically driven and in direct contrast to the commissioner's own request not to jump to any conclusions until the entire investigation is complete,"" union President Gene Ryan said in a written statement.\n\nFive of the six officers involved in the arrest have provided statements to investigators, Batts said. The sixth officer has invoked his right to refuse to answer questions.\n\nAnd while the preliminary work on Gray's autopsy has been completed, the medical examiner's office is waiting on toxicology results and might ask spinal experts to look at the case, authorities said. A full report could take 30 to 45 days.\n\nNot just Freddie Gray: Others who died in police custody\n\nHolly Yan reported and wrote from Atlanta; Miguel Marquez reported from Baltimore. CNN's Ben Brumfield, Betsy Klein and Vivian Kuo contributed to this report.", Eric Garner's family and other members of Families United for Justice will attend Gray's funeral. Gray was arrested April 12 and died a week later from a severe spinal cord injury. Three White House officials will also attend Gray's funeral.,"[""There's not a single mention of police, brutality, or Gray dying in their custody from untreated injuries. These are all key points. Point off for coherence because there is no mention of Garner's background. Needs context.

Under legal pressure, the Obama administration will begin telling some suspected terrorists if and why they are on a list of tens of thousands of people banned from flying to, from or within the U.S. Above the security line at New York John F Kennedy International Airport in October \n\nBut the American Civil Liberties Union, which has been challenging the constitutionality of the no-fly list in an ongoing federal lawsuit, said the changes don't go far enough in giving travelers the legal due process they are entitled to, including seeing the evidence held against them and getting an opportunity to challenge it.\n\nThe explanations provided to six travelers so far, which were mandated by a federal judge, have been inadequate, the ACLU said.\n\nFor instance, in a letter to New Jersey resident Amir Meshal, the government's explanation for his inclusion on the list was based on information the FBI obtained from Meshal when he was detained in Africa in 2007, ACLU attorney Hina Shamsi said. The ACLU considers Meshal's detention to be unlawful and said he suffered abuse.\n\n'From the face of the letter, a neutral decision-maker would have no idea whatsoever that any of that occurred,' said Shamsi.\n\nThe Justice Department declined to comment on the specific constitutionality challenges because of the ongoing lawsuit.\n\nJustice Department spokeswoman Nicole Navas said, 'We are committed to a process that protects Americans from terrorist threats while respecting privacy and safeguarding civil liberties.'\n\nLast fall, there were about 64,000 people on the no-fly list, according to the government. Typically, less than 5 per cent of those on the list are Americans. The list fluctuates in size.\n\nPreviously, the government's policy was never to confirm or deny that a person actually is on list, citing national security concerns. \n\nIn most instances, travelers assume they are on the list because they are instructed to go through additional screening at airports or because they are told they can't board their flights.\n\nTravelers have been able to appeal their presumed placement on the list since 2007. Only a small percentage of appeals the government receives each year have been from travelers actually on the list, the government has said. \n\nThe TSA gets between 15,000 and 20,000 requests a year, and less than 1 per cent of those are actually from people on the no-fly list, said Homeland Security spokeswoman Marsha Catron.\n\nIn 2014, a federal judge in Portland, Oregon, required that the government notify 13 plaintiffs challenging the constitutionality of the no-fly list of their status on the list, and seven were told they were not on the list.\n\nThe government provided explanations to the six plaintiffs it confirmed were on the no-fly list, including Meshal. One of the explanations included just a 'single cryptic sentence about alleged travel to a foreign country,' according a court document filed earlier this year. \n\nThe letters to the six plaintiffs on the no-fly list have been redacted on the public court docket to protect the plaintiffs' reputations, Shamsi said.\n\n'The government had an opportunity to come up with a fair process but failed, so we're challenging it in court again,' Shamsi said.\n\nThe TSA will continue to handle the petitions under the new policy. The changes are not yet in effect, and have so far only been applied to the 13 plaintiffs in the Portland lawsuit, but the Homeland Security Department said it expects them be in place soon. Catron said individual requests should take months to process, not years.\n\n'These enhancements continue to ensure that individuals who are deemed to be a threat to our aviation security are prohibited from boarding a flight within, or bound for, the United States,' Catron said."," Previously, the U.S. did not disclose whether a stopped traveler was on the list or why. But facing legal pressure from the ACLU, the Obama administration has enacted a new policy to let Americans know if they are on the list. Grounded Americans are also now allowed to inquire about how they got on the list. However, the government has not promised to reveal why in all cases - citing possible national security threats .  Last fall there were about 64,000 people on the no-fly list, and Americans made up approximately 5 per cent .","['This summary is a good representation of the article.', 'The summary is a good representation of the post, however it is unclear if the legal pressure stems from ACLU.. as it is not explicit in the article. \\nAlso, it is over national security concerns that not all cases will be revealed to be on the list (not over national security ""threats"").', '""Previously, the U.S. did not disclose whether a stopped traveler was on the list or why."" which list is talked?

He has made 700 professional club appearances and won 81 caps for England, six Premier League titles, the FA Cup and the Champions League.\n\nIn his pomp, he was the stuff of strikers' nightmares, driving some of the world's greatest goalscorers to distraction with lightning-sharp reactions and an instinctive reading of the game.\n\nThat's why it's such a shame that what is likely to be Rio Ferdinand's farewell year in the English game has fizzled out.\n\nRio Ferdinand pictured in training at Queens Park Rangers last week. The 36-year-old defender started regularly in the first part of the season but has been unable to hold down his spot in the side\n\nFerdinand started the first seven matches of QPR's Premier League campaign before being dropped\n\nFerdinand has enjoyed a fantastic career, winning six Premier League titles, but a fairytale finish is unlikely\n\nFerdinand and Ryan Giggs lift the European Cup for Manchester United in Moscow back in 2008\n\nFerdinand also won 81 caps for England during his glittering career\n\nHe would love to be out there, hunting down and hassling opponents, robbing attackers of the ball, winning the aerial duels, playing his part in Queens Park Rangers' survival mission.\n\nKeeping them up would be a fitting curtain call. Instead, Ferdinand's season has been one spent on the margins - either suspended, benched or out of the squad altogether.\n\nOnce again, the 36-year-old was forced to watch on from the sidelines as Rangers claimed a potentially crucial point away to Aston Villa on Tuesday night. Ferdinand had picked up a slight knock and was ruled out.\n\nHe has played just five times since the start of October - not much of a swansong. On Sunday, he posted a Twitter picture of a pile of chicken bones after lunch at his mum's. \n\nHe had not been involved in the 4-1 win at West Brom 24 hours earlier and it weirdly seemed to sum up his peripheral role at the moment.\n\nBy contrast, Ferdinand had started QPR's first seven games of the campaign, lasting the full 90 minutes in all of them.\n\nHarry Redknapp had grand plans and the best of intentions last summer. Having called time on his Manchester United career after 12 trophy-laden seasons, Ferdinand moved to Loftus Road in what Redknapp described as a 'remarkable coup for the club.'\n\nHarry Redknapp described Ferdinand's signing last summer as a 'remarkable coup' for the club\n\nBut after initial promise, Ferdinand has largely spent the season on the bench\n\nPremier League (6): 2002-03, 2006-07, 2007-08, 2008-09, 2010-11, 2012-13\n\nFA Cup (1): 2003-04\n\nFootball League Cup (2): 2005-06, 2008-09\n\nFA Community Shield (5): 2003, 2007, 2008, 2011, 2013\n\nChampions League (1): 2007-08\n\nFIFA Club World Cup (1): 2008\n\nEven in his mid-thirties, Redknapp believed Ferdinand would bring 'quality, class, experience and know-how' as QPR returned to the top flight.\n\nHe envisaged Ferdinand in a sweeper role, the central pivot of a three-man defence in an in-vogue 3-5-2 system. He would bring all that experience to bear, helping Clint Hill and Steven Caulker keep opposition attacks at bay.\n\nUnfortunately, it just didn't work. In their first seven Premier League games of the season, QPR won one, drew one and lost five. They leaked 15 goals and the scale of their task in staying in the top division was clear.\n\nFerdinand was demoted to the bench, Richard Dunne and Nedum Onuoha were introduced and the dye was cast for the season.\n\nHis suspension for using the word 'sket' in a tweet didn't help and by the time that was served, Ferdinand was down the pecking order.\n\nFerdinand has shown glimpses of his imperious best for QPR this season\n\nBut Ferdinand's farewell season in English football has not lived up to his expectations\n\nChris Ramsey has played Ferdinand on three occasions since taking over from Harry Redknapp\n\nQueens Park Rangers find themselves two points from safety after their 3-3 draw at Aston Villa on Tuesday\n\nAs you would expect, Ferdinand has conducted himself like a model professional on the training ground, maintaining his fitness in case he was called upon.\n\nAnd there have been such occasions, notably the 2-0 win at Sunderland in February - Chris Ramsey's second game in charge after replacing Redknapp, that ended QPR's 11-game losing run on the road.\n\nFerdinand may yet be called upon again in the run-in, with QPR sitting two points shy of safety, but the season so far will have fallen short of his hopes and expectations.\n\nThat fairytale finale, with Ferdinand leading an heroic resistance to keep Rangers in the Premier League, seems unlikely.\n\nThere are rumours that clubs in the money-soaked Qatar Stars League are preparing to tempt Ferdinand with one final payday but that remains to be seen.\n\nFor now, Rio's farewell has sadly fallen a bit flat.\n\nThe fixtures remaining for the bottom six in the Barclays Premier League", Rio Ferdinand missed 3-3 thriller with Aston Villa through injury. He has featured in just five QPR matches since the start of October . Harry Redknapp initially wanted him to be at centre of a back three. But the plan backfired as Rangers made a poor start in Premier League. Ferdinand has found it difficult to regain his place in farewell year .,['This summary is a good one.

'Now, obviously, it's fine.'\n\nHowever this is not the first time that the 49-year-old photographer who has shot everyone from Miley Cyrus to Kim Kardashian in his New York studio has faced controversy. \n\nIn fact, to say Richarson's reputation precedes him would be an understatement. He is the man who the Guardian once referred to as 'fashion's shameful secret'.\n\nKnown to many as 'Uncle Terry,' one of his more controversial shots includes a woman giving a man - thought to be Terry - fellatio whilst he is dressed as a horse.\n\nFurther sexual shots show Richardson completely nude dressed as the devil and with models who are sexually stimulating him with their hands or mouths. \n\nTerry is a regular on the red carpet at some of the biggest event sin the world, he is pictured here heading into the Vanity Fair Oscar's party \n\nIndeed it's been more than ten years since Terry first hit the headlines for his questionable behaviour.\n\nIn 2004 an intern named 'Alex' was photographed performing oral sex on the photographer while wearing a tiara labelled 'slut', something which the Terry described at the time as, 'It's Sesame Street!'\n\nThen in 2009, a model called Sena Cech claimed that Terry's assistant had asked her to give him a handjob, apparently telling her: 'Sena, can you grab his c*** and twist it real hard? He likes it when you squeeze it real hard and twist it.'\n\nIn 2010 a model named Rie Rasmussen confronted Terry at a party in Paris after he placed pictures of her next to underage models in his book - in America, models under the age of 18 are considered underage. \n\nShe said: 'He takes girls who are young, manipulates them to take their clothes off and takes pictures of them they will be ashamed of. \n\n'They are too afraid to say no because their agency booked them on the job and are too young to stand up for themselves.'\n\nTerry poses with Pharrell Williams (left) and James Franco (right) doing his signature thumbs up pose\n\nTerry is good friends with Lady Gaga who has previously starred in his risque shoots - the pair were spotted hanging out together in New York in 2010\n\nFurthermore in 2010 one of the most disturbing allegations was made against Richardson. \n\nOne model named Jamie Peck revealed that when she was 19 she worked with the photographer on two separate occasions. \n\nJamie said that the second time she had her period and Terry asked 'to take my tampon out for him to play with. ""I love tampons!"" he said, in that psychotically upbeat way that temporarily convinces so many girls that what's fun for Uncle Terry is fun for them.'\n\nShe refers to the fact that Terry wanted to make 'Tampon tea,' with her used sanitary product.  \n\nJamie revealed that she also sexually stimulated the photographer with her hand and was encouraged to do so not only by Terry but by his team after he took all of his clothes off. \n\nTerry once told the Observer of his shoots: 'A lot of it starts with me saying to a girl, ""Do you want to do nudes?"" And they're like, ""I don't want to be naked"".\n\n'So I say, ""I'll be naked and you take the pictures. You can have the camera. You can have the phallus"".'\n\nDespite the allegations which have been levied against him Terry remains popular within the fashion industry pictured here with Ralph Lauren and Emmanuelle Alt \n\nLast year model Sara Ziff spoke to Huffington Post Live about working with Terry and said: 'You are going to a casting to possibly shoot with him for Harper's Bazaar, whose one of his clients. \n\n'That's a legitimate job, and he will ask you to take your clothes off for the casting and in some cases give him sexual favors. \n\n'I have spoken with other models who have been in these situations, and he makes you feel like you're being a prude or you are somehow weird if you are not willing to just go with the flow because it's all cool. It's all fine.'\n\nShe also revealed that there is a, 'ring of silence,' in the fashion industry as young women feel pressured to keep quite in order to further their careers.  \n\nRichardson rarely responds to the allegations levied against him, but in March 2014 - after a model posted a piece on Reddit including a string of sexual assault accusations he wrote an open letter for Page Six.\n\nCharlotte Waters claimed that during her shoot Terry became aggressive and it 'became sexual act after sexual act.'\n\nTerry poses with Hilton sisters Paris (left) and Nicky (right) at the opening of his Terrywood exhibition in 2012\n\nIn the letter, posted by the US gossip website, Richardson said that the accusations were 'false,' 'hate filled libelous tales.' \n\nHe said: 'Enabled and protected by the freewheeling and often times anonymous nature of the Internet, people have become comfortable concocting hate-filled and libelous tales about my professional and personal lives. \n\n'In writing this, I make a humble attempt at correcting these rumors, because I have come to realize that absent my voice in the conversation, all that remain are the lies.' \n\nHe said: 'I have never used an offer of work or a threat of rebuke to coerce someone into something that they did not want to do. \n\n'I give everyone that I work with enough respect to view them as having ownership of their free will and making their decisions accordingly, and as such, it has been difficult to see myself as a target of revisionist history.'\n\nThe model Daisy Lowe has previously defended Terry saying: 'He just exudes this sexual energy, so he doesn't need to ask girls to take off their clothes. Honestly, they just do it.' \n\nTerry poses with troubled actress Lindsay Lohan \n\nTerry's lost numerous over the years and there are many people in the fashion industry who no longer work with him. \n\nThese include shopping giants Target and H&M and brands such as Vogue, the New York Times and Equinox. \n\nThe model Coco Rocha said in 2010: 'I've shot with [Terry Richardson], but I didn't feel comfortable and I won't do it again.' \n\nHowever Richardson remains popular within the celebrity circuit and is often seen partying with the likes of Kanye West and Pharrell Williams.\n\nAnd he still works with the likes of Harper's Bazaar and brands such as Supreme and Yves Saint Laurent. Designer Marc Jacobs once defended Terry as being, 'not ill-spirited.' \n\nTerry's career as a photographer came after he failed to make it as a punk rock musician. He got his first big break in 1994 with a shoot for Vibe magazine. \n\nSince then he has enjoyed a stint living in London working for publications such as The Face and Arena but now shoots mainly from his studio in New York.\n\nThe photographer has also directly music videos in his time. One of the most controversial was for Lady Gaga. \n\nTerry shot the video for Do What U Want a collaboration between Gaga and R Kelly last year, however, the project was later scrapped. \n\nTMZ later obtained a clip of the highly sexualised film which one anonymous source told the New York Post was, 'literally an ad for rape.'\n\nThe clip shows Gaga lying on a hospital bed, she is put under anesthetic by R Kelly who then fondles her body along with a series of models.  \n\nMailOnline have contacted a representative for Terry for comment.", Terry Richardson is accused of releasing film without model permission. The minute-long footage shows Upton dancing in a skimpy bikini . The photographer has long courted controversy. He has previously been accused of sexual assaulting young models .

It is one of the biggest takeovers ever.\n\nNews of the deal has driven up the price of shares in BG now owned by people who originally bought British Gas shares in 1986. \n\nBritish Gas was privatised by Margaret Thatcher's government after the widely publicised 'Tell Sid' campaign. The share sell-off, which encouraged people to spread news of the offer with the slogan 'If you see Sid, tell him', saw more than 1.5million people pay 135p a share when the company was listed on the Stock Exchange.\n\nIn 1997 British Gas was split in two to form the oil explorer BG Group and the British Gas owner Centrica. Shareholders received shares in both companies.\n\nThose investors who retained these shares have since received hundreds of pounds in dividends. Anyone who bought 100 shares at the time of privatisation would have paid £135 (£366 today, after taken inflation into account). The holding across the now separate companies of Centrica, National Grid and BG Group, is currently worth more than £1,604. \n\nThe proposed Shell takeover will mean investors are now due 383p for every BG share they own. Investors will also be in line for higher dividends. But the windfall pales in comparison to the rewards for BG Group's newly arrived chief executive Helge Lund who could be in line for more than £30million in pay and perks if the deal completes next year. \n\nBen van Beurden, CEO of Royal Dutch Shell, (left) shakes hands with the Chairman GB group Andrew Gould (right)  during a press conference to announce Royal Dutch Shell has agreed to buy British Gas, in London\n\nMr Lund was poached by BG to help turn around the group and started in February, just weeks before talks to sell the business began.\n\nThe takeover, which will create a company valued at £200billion, could be the first of many in the oil sector as the falling oil price, means firms are vulnerable to predators.\n\nThe bid has been months in the planning. Shell 'ran the numbers' on BG, Britain's third largest energy company, last year as its share price has fallen by a fifth since the oil price crash.\n\nHis signing-on bonus was cut from £12 million to £10.8 million in December amid outrage from investors\n\nShell's chief executive Ben van Beurden made a call to BG's chairman Andrew Gould on Sunday March 15 and a 'cloak and dagger' meeting took place at the Dorchester Hotel last month. \n\nHe described the deal as a 'fantastic fit' and said the 'logic' to buy BG has always been there but that the falling oil price made it a 'whole lot more compelling'.\n\nThe deal will have to be approved by a series of regulatory bodies worldwide including the European Commission.\n\nShell employs more than 94,000 people across 70 countries. BG has 5,200 staff across 24 countries. News of the merger led to job fears. In the UK Shell has around 6,500 staff while BG employs around 1,600.

Researchers in Massachusetts say a person's keystrokes may reveal a huge amount of information about their motor skills\n\nFor the body to begin moving, the brain's primary motor cortex sends signals through several other brain regions, including the supplementary motor area, cerebellum, and basal ganglia.\n\nThese brain areas activate spinal neurons that stimulate muscles to execute the movement.\n\nBut many factors can interfere with motor ability, including sleep deprivation, which reduces dexterity.\n\nIn people with Parkinson's disease, dopamine-producing cells in part of the brain called the substantia nigra are killed off, leading to tremors, slowness of movement, and difficulty walking\n\nResearchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology have now created an algorithm that can tell how effectively someone is striking a keypad.\n\nFor instance, it can distinguish between typing done in the middle of the night, when sleep deprivation impairs motor skills, and typing performed when fully rested.\n\nIt does this by analysing something known as 'key hold time' - a measure of how long a key is pressed before being released.\n\nThe study is based on the premise that 'there might be hidden information in the way that we type,' says Ian Butterworth, one of researchers.\n\n'At the moment, pretty much all of the other information in typing is thrown out. We just pay attention to what keys are being pressed, not when or for how long.'\n\nScientists have developed a six-minute test which could give an early diagnosis of Parkinson's disease.\n\nCurrently Parkinson's patients only discover they have the debilitating neurological problem when the symptoms have already taken hold.\n\nBut last year Oxford University academics have come up with a new way of spotting the disease at an early stage.\n\nThe researchers were able to detect early Parkinson's disease with a remarkable 85 per cent accuracy.\n\nThe technique uses an MRI scanner to monitor the neural connections in a concentrated area at the very centre of the brain.\n\nEven at a very early stage, Parkinson's patients had much weaker connections in the basal ganglia region of the brain, which is associated with motor control.\n\nThe study, which has been published in the journal Neurology, found that by taking 180 pictures in six minutes they could spot the poor connections.\n\nThey also found that the test had a very low chance of incorrectly diagnosing healthy people with the disease.\n\nThis study focused on the effects of fatigue, but the researchers say they could diagnose conditions that impair motor function, such as Parkinson's disease, much earlier than is now possible.\n\nPreliminary results from a study of about two dozen Parkinson's patients suggest that the researchers' algorithm for analysing keystrokes can also distinguish people who have the disease from those who don't.\n\nThe team is now planning a larger study of Parkinson's patients.\n\nThey are also working on smartphone apps that could be used to gather the same kind of data from mobile devices.\n\n'We thought this was a unique opportunity to have a window into the brain using your normal interactions with an electronic device,' says MIT researcher Alvaro Sanchez-Ferro.\n\n'You already have the hardware. You just have to let someone evaluate the information you collect every day when you use the device, and try to pull it out for health-related purposes.'\n\nPeople are usually diagnosed with Parkinson's disease five to 10 years after the beginning of the disease, and lot of the damage has already been done, the researchers say.\n\nJohn Growdon, director of the Memory and Movement Disorders Unit at Massachusetts General Hospital, says it will be important for the researchers to demonstrate in future studies that the typing deficiencies correlate with the severity of Parkinson's disease.\n\n'Overall, it strikes me that this has great potential to detect subtle motor impairments even in advance of a clinician's ability to find them,' adds Growdon, who was not involved in the study.\n\nThe researchers believe this strategy could also be used to evaluate patients with other diseases that affect motor skills, such as rheumatoid arthritis.\n\n'This might have applications in any disease producing a motor impairment, whether it's in your hands and muscles or the brain,' Sanchez-Ferro says.\n\nThe team are working on smartphone apps that may be used to gather the same type of data from mobiles"," MIT's algorithm reveals how effectively someone is striking keys. It does this by studying how long key is pressed before being released. Team are working on an app that gathers same data from a smartphone.

Tate Britain chiefs believe the chance discovery of a 1946 export permit (pictured) will bolster their claim that Constable's painting was legitimately brought to Britain\n\nConstable's masterpiece Beaching A Boat, Brighton was looted by the Nazis from its Jewish owner during the Second World War\n\nThe discovery of the permit in the archives of Budapest's Museum of Fine Arts is the latest twist in an increasingly fraught dispute between the Tate and the descendants of the painting's original owner, Baron Ferenc Hatvany, who died in 1958.\n\nThe descendants of Hatvany – believed to be two daughters and a grandchild – say the Nazis stole the painting and smuggled it out of Hungary.\n\nIt turned up in Britain in 1962 and passed through several hands before being donated to the Tate in 1986.\n\nThe family launched a claim three years ago. The Government-backed Spoliation Advisory Panel, which rules on disputes over looted art, supported the heirs last year and said the Tate had a 'moral obligation' to return the painting. Sources close to the case say the export permit could prove the Tate's claim that Hatvany voluntarily disposed of the painting while he was still alive.\n\nThe Tate does not dispute that the painting was looted by the Nazis but the gallery's understanding is that it was returned to the owner after the war and then legitimately exported.\n\nStormy seas: The battle over Constable's painting evokes the story of a Jewish refugee's fight to reclaim a looted picture in the film Woman in Gold (pictured)\n\nGallery chiefs are expected to argue that the permit proves the work was still in Hungary after the war. But The Mail on Sunday understands the claimants will argue the permit doesn't change anything as it does not identify Hatvany.\n\nOne source said: 'If you had stolen the painting, you would still need to get an export permit to get it out of the country.'\n\nA source at the Tate explained that there was legal duty to protect any assets owned by the British public, which is why the gallery argued that the painting should remain in the UK. \n\nThey said: 'No one disputes that the picture was at one stage looted by the Nazis, what is in dispute is what happened after it was returned to its owner.'\n\nThe dispute evokes the story of Dame Helen Mirren's new film, Woman In Gold, which charts the story of how Jewish refugee Maria Altmann battled for almost a decade with the Austrian government to reclaim Gustav Klimt's iconic picture of her aunt called Portrait Of Adele Bloch-Bauer I."," 'Beaching A Boat, Brighton' taken from Jewish owner in Second World War.

They said a particle accelerator could be sent 185 miles (300km) up into space (illustration of a satellite in orbit shown). It would then fire high-energy beams back at Earth's atmosphere\n\nThe study, published in the Journal of Geophysical Research, was picked up by Mark Zastrow from Eos.\n\nThe accelerator being proposed would be three times stronger than anything like it before, producing a beam with particles 0.5 to 10 million electron volts.\n\nPulses of the beam would last just 0.1 microseconds.\n\nThe accelerator would be located in space, 185 miles (300km) above the ground, and would fire back towards Earth's atmosphere.\n\nThere are two types of auroras on Earth - the Aurora Borealis in the Northern Hemisphere, known as the Northern Lights, and the Aurora Australis in the Southern Hemisphere, known as the Southern Lights.\n\nAuroras occur when highly charged electrons from the solar wind collide with atoms of oxygen and nitrogen in the earth's atmosphere at altitudes from 20 to 200 miles (32 to 320km) above the planet's surface. The interactions between the charged particles give off light.\n\nAuroral displays appear in many colours: red, yellow, green, blue, and violet.\n\nThe color of the aurora depends on which atom is struck, and the altitude of the meeting. The common green hue is caused by colliding oxygen molecules at altitudes of up to 150 miles (240km).\n\nIt would be based on a instrument called the Compact Particle Accelerator for Space Science (Compass), which is being developed by the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory and SRI International, both in California.\n\n'The authors say that employing such instrumentation would offer many scientific opportunities to study the behaviour of particles in the upper atmosphere,' wrote Mr Zastrow.\n\n'The paths of the electrons would trace out the arcing field lines of Earth's magnetic field, illustrating how they bend and snap during the intense geomagnetic activity caused by solar storms.\n\n'As they descend into the Earth's atmosphere, some of the electrons would strike atmospheric molecules, producing visible aurora-like emission.'\n\nHe added that the beam might even be able to trigger different forms of lightning, including red sprites and blue jets.\n\nFor now the idea is only a concept, and there are no concrete plans to build it.\n\nBut the team says that by proving it works, it could be a step towards actually making it.\n\nThere are two types of auroras on Earth - the Aurora Borealis in the Northern Hemisphere, known as the Northern Lights, and the Aurora Australis in the Southern Hemisphere, known as the Southern Lights. Shown is the Aurora Borealis above the Snaefellsnes Peninsula in Iceland\n\nIt would not be the first experiment with Earth's atmosphere, though.\n\nIn Alaska there is an ionospheric research programmed called the High Frequency Active Auroral Research Program (Haarp).\n\nHaarp is jointly funded by the US Air Force, the US Navy, the University of Alaska, and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (Darpa).\n\nIt was established to analyse the ionosphere - a region of the upper atmosphere - and investigate the development of ionospheric enhancement technology for radio communications and surveillance.\n\nIn Alaska there is already an ionospheric research programmed called the High Frequency Active Auroral Research Program (Haarp), pictured. It was established to analyse the ionosphere - a region of the upper atmosphere - and investigate the development of ionospheric enhancement technology\n\nThe station regularly uses a tool called the Ionospheric Research Instrument (IRI), a high-power radio frequency transmitter facility operating in the high frequency band. It is used to temporarily excite a limited area of the Ionosphere.\n\nHaarp has been the subject of numerous unfounded conspiracy theories.\n\nIt has been blamed for hurricanes, thunderstorms, major power outages and more, but no convincing evidence supports any of the claims.", Scientists in California described how to create artificial auroras on Earth.

\n\nShould TV ads promoting unhealthy food and drink be banned until the watershed, or wiped out altogether to save adults' waistlines too? \n\nA recent survey by the British Heart Foundation showed two fifths of parents are badgered by their children each week to buy food after seeing it advertised on TV, prompting the charity to deliver a 30,000 strong petition asking the Government to ban junk food adverts being shown before the 9pm watershed\n\nA recent British Heart Foundation survey quizzed more than 2,000 parents with children under the age of 16.\n\nIt showed two fifths of them are badgered by their children each week to buy food after seeing it advertised on TV, and feel that TV junk food adverts make it difficult to help their children eat a healthy diet. \n\nIf you are a parent like me, you are probably nodding knowingly about now.\n\nThere is plenty of scientific evidence to back up our frustrations too – showing that food commercials aimed at children focus on products high in fat, salt and sugar, and that youngsters develop positive attitudes towards the foods they see advertised.\n\nDespite regulation, children in the UK are still being exposed to more TV advertising for unhealthy than healthy food items, even at peak children's viewing times. \n\nWhat's more, regulation doesn't prevent the advertising of unhealthy products during programmes in the 'family entertainment' bracket, which include some of the most popular television programmes watched by children such as X-Factor and Britain's Got Talent.\n\nSeven in ten parents said they would like stricter regulation on the food industry's use of advertising. \n\nGood on them. \n\nThe BHF has therefore just delivered a 30,000 strong petition, asking Government to ban junk food adverts from being shown before the 9pm watershed, to help protect our children from making unhealthy choices.\n\nDo you think the big food and drink manufacturers are unduly worried about this? \n\nNot when they can use one of our national icons to act as a giant advertising hoarding instead.\n\nDr Sally Norton criticised Coca-Cola's sponsorship of the London Eye, noting it gives the company the chance to advertise to almost four million visitors a year\n\nAs someone at the forefront of managing obesity, I am furious that we are allowing blatant advertising to influence our children in other ways. \n\nTake Coca-Cola's sponsorship of the London Eye. \n\nWith London Eye staff apparently wearing Coca-Cola branded uniforms to match the promotional material displayed around this family attraction, the company gets the chance to advertise to 3.75 million direct visitors a year. \n\nWhat's more, we will do plenty of advertising for them as we promote the 'Coca-Cola' London Eye, our top paid-for tourist attraction, around the world.\n\nAs Coca-Cola knows all too well, linking its product to happy and exciting events such as visiting the London Eye is likely to forever link Coca-Cola to the idea of 'fun' in the minds of young, impressionable kids (and adults).\n\nDr Norton backs the British Heart Foundation's bid to ban TV junk food ads before 9pm\n\nMerlin Entertainments, who own the London Eye, said customers were able to make their own minds up about what to include in their diets. \n\nTrue – but the stark truth is that we aren't making the best choices, with two thirds of us overweight, a quarter of us obese and the NHS spending £6 billion pounds a year on obesity.\n\nThat same 'failure of personal responsibility' meant the Government recognised that we needed extra help to tackle smoking – and widespread advertising bans and preventing smoking inside public buildings was implemented. \n\nIn just the same way, we can't tackle obesity alone and need help – not giant Coca-Cola branded wheels reminding us of the sugar-laden temptations it promotes.\n\nReducing TV advertising to children as the British Heart Foundation are suggesting, will, of course reduce the number of junk food advertisements children see. \n\nBut, as the London Eye disgrace shows, junk food advertising isn't limited to TV.\n\nThere are plenty of ways by which companies can market to kids or adults outside of TV advertising and the regulations for non-broadcast advertising are currently weak or non-existent.\n\nOur children seem to spend an increasing amount of time online, actively engaging in social media, and the junk food and drink manufacturers are busy providing games, social networking apps and other tools to promote their brands in cyberspace where the adults often fear to tread.\n\nA study by the Children's Food Campaign, of 100 websites featuring food likely to be bought or requested by children, found that more than 80 per cent of online adverts were associated with foods classed as less healthy and therefore not allowed to be advertised during children's TV programmes.\n\nYet more than 75 per cent featured child-friendly characters, competitions, downloads and links to social media apps that directly engaged with kids.\n\nThis is because the internet regulations don't prevent our kids being targeted and manipulated in this way.\n\nThis 21st century method of targeting our teens is a sneaky way of tapping into a 'screen-obsessed' generation.\n\nShe says: 'As Coca-Cola knows all too well, linking its product to happy and exciting events such as visiting the London Eye is likely to forever link Coca-Cola to the idea of 'fun' in the minds of impressionable kids' \n\nSponsorship, whether of tourist attractions or sporting events like the Olympics, is another great way of ensuring that products trigger positive connections – harnessing the feel-good factor, which can last well into the future. \n\nInterestingly, research has also shown that companies seen to be involved in 'charitable' activities or corporate social responsibility can lead consumers to infer that their products are healthier and even lower in calories, leading them to consume more.\n\nTheir good deeds create a 'health halo' effect, just in the same way labelling and packaging can persuade consumers that they are buying a healthy, 'natural' products for themselves or their children.\n\nSneaky junk food advertising is invading all aspects of life – how can we resist?\n\nSo, it's a big 'yes please' to banning junk food advertising before 9pm. \n\nBut don't think for a minute that this will deter manufacturers of the high sugar, high fat, processed food that provides little, if any, nutritional benefit for our kids. \n\nPlenty of other advertising opportunities are open and they are busy working on how to manipulate us and our kids into buying more and more of the heavily processed rubbish that is damaging our health.\n\nTo read more visit www.vavista.com"," Worldwide, 42 million children under the age of 5 are overweight or obese.

Carrseville is just six miles from where the remains were found\n\nFears: The 18-year-old freshman vanished while home on spring break from Longwood University\n\nBut Hadsell, who had been working in nearby Franklin, around the time of the disappearance, said he was only thinking about his daughter.\n\n'I couldn't sit a minute away from where my daughter may have been,' he told WAVY.com.\n\nWhile searching the property for around 15 minutes, he claims that he discovered her jacket.\n\n'I was just trying to make the evidence come to light,' he said. 'It's not like I had the jacket, I didn't plant the jacket, I didn't know anything about that. It was the fact of the overwhelming information that led me there.'  \n\nThe stepfather has aroused local suspicions because he has a lengthy felony criminal record.\n\nIn 2005, his ex-wife went missing for several days and he was reportedly arrested after allegedly kidnapping her and driving her across multiple states.\n\nConcern: Her grandmother Katherine Hadsell said earlier this week that she did not think police were doing enough to find the teenager. She argued that her son, Wesley Hadsell, had been arrested unfairly\n\nCharges of rape, kidnapping, assault and domestic violence were later dropped. \n\nHe also served 54 months in prison for a bank robbery in Fredericksburg, Virginia, according to WTKR - but he insists that he is now a changed man.  \n\nAnd in another twist, Jennifer Busby, AJ's mother, said she received texts from her daughter's phone shortly after he disappearance but was not convinced she was actually messaging the girl.\n\nAJ is described as standing at 5 feet 6 inches tall and weighing 120 pounds."," Anjelica 'AJ' Hadsell, 18, has been missing since March 2, when she was home in Norfolk while on spring break from Longwood University.

Every two years it appears 'bands' of magnetic field move to the surface. This combines with the existing 11-year solar cycle, causing even more powerful coronal mass ejections (CMEs), pictured, and solar flares that can endanger Earth\n\nThe study was carried out by a team of researchers led by the National Centre for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) in Colorado.\n\nThey found that the changes seem to be driven by bands of strong magnetic fields in the sun's hemispheres which emanate from the solar interior.\n\nIt was already known that the sun goes through a solar cycle of 11 years, during which its activity increases and decreases.\n\nSolar flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs) can damage satellites and have an enormous financial cost.\n\nThe charged particles can also threaten airlines by disturbing the Earth's magnetic field.\n\nVery large flares can even create currents within electricity grids and knock out energy supplies.\n\nA positive aspect, from an aesthetic point of view, is that the auroras are enhanced.\n\nGeomagnetic storms are more disruptive now than in the past because of our greater dependence on technical systems that can be affected by electric currents.\n\nBut this shorter two-year season seems to also play a part in the sun's activity, on a similar scale to the 11-year cycle - despite being much quicker.\n\nThe new solar season occurs when twisted, ring-shaped 'bands' of magnetic field rise from the solar interior and pass to the surface through the tachocline - a 'transition' region in the outer third of the sun.\n\n'Much like Earth's jet stream, whose warps and waves have had severe impact on our regional weather patterns in the past couple of winters, the bands on the sun have very slow-moving waves that can expand and warp it too,' said co-author Dr Robert Leamon, a scientist at Montana State University.\n\n'Sometimes this results in magnetic fields leaking from one band to the other.\n\n'In other cases, the warp drags magnetic fields from deep in the solar interior, near the tachocline, and pushes them toward the surface.' \n\nThe result of this motion is that the bands create turbulent regions of activity on the surface, causing solar flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs).\n\nCMEs are the huge waves of material that are seen in images of the sun, and they can pose a threat to satellites in Earth orbit.\n\nSolar flares are flashes of energy on the surface of the sun, which are sometimes associated with CMEs - although their connection is not well understood.\n\nThe new solar season discovery occurs when twisted, ring-shaped 'bands' of magnetic field rise from the solar interior and pass to the surface through the tachocline - a 'transition' region in the outer third of the sun. Shown in this illustration are the various different regions of the sun and a sunspot (top right)\n\nThe bands, which appear in each hemisphere of the sun, cause the 11-year solar cycle to actually become a longer cycle that lasts 22 years.\n\nThe 11-year solar cycle sees a periodic change in the sun's activity - such as the number of ejections - in addition to changes in the number of sunspots, flares and other visible differences.\n\nA solar flare occurs when magnetic energy that has built up in the solar atmosphere is suddenly released.\n\nRadiation is emitted across virtually the entire electromagnetic spectrum, from radio waves at the long wavelength end, through optical emission to X-rays and gamma rays at the short wavelength end.\n\nThe amount of energy released is the equivalent of millions of 100-megaton hydrogen bombs exploding at the same time\n\nA flare occurs when magnetic energy that has built up in the solar atmosphere is suddenly released - mostly in the active regions around sunspots.\n\nTheir frequency varies from several a day, when the sun is particularly active, to less than one a week during quiet periods. \n\nHowever, the cause of the 11-year cycle is poorly understood.\n\nAnd according to this new research, when the 11-year cycle combines with the two-year cycle, the solar storms that pummel Earth's atmosphere can be amplified.\n\nThe bands  appear to take place separately in the northern and southern hemispheres, with activity peaking over 11 months, then dropping over another 11 months.\n\nThe almost annual variations can be likened to regions on Earth that have two seasons, such as a rainy season and a dry season.\n\n'What we're looking at here is a massive driver of solar storms,' said Dr Scott McIntosh, lead author of the new study and director of NCAR's High Altitude Observatory.\n\n'By better understanding how these activity bands form in the sun and cause seasonal instabilities, there's the potential to greatly improve forecasts of space weather events.' \n\nThe overlapping bands are fueled by the rotation of the sun's deep interior, according to observations by the research team. \n\nThe study, published this week in Nature Communications, could help lead to better predictions of massive geomagnetic storms in Earth's outer atmosphere that sometimes disrupt satellite operations, communications, power grids and other technologies.\n\nThe research was funded by Nasa and the National Science Foundation, which is NCAR's sponsor.\n\nThe 11-year solar cycle sees a periodic change in the sun's activity - such as the number of ejections - in addition to changes in the number of sunspots, flares and other visible differences. Shown here are images of the sun over one cycle showing changes in its activity\n\nThe surges of magnetic fuel from the Sun's interior catastrophically destabilise the corona, the sun's outermost atmosphere. They are the driving force behind the most destructive solar storms.\n\n'These surges or ""whomps"" as we have dubbed them, are responsible for over 95 per cent of the large flares and CMEs - the ones that are really devastating,' Dr McIntosh said.\n\nThe almost-annual variability can also help explain a cold-war era puzzle: why do powerful solar flares and CMEs often peak a year or more after the maximum number of sunspots?\n\nThis lag is known as the Gnevyshev Gap, after the Soviet scientist who first reported it in the 1940s.\n\nThe answer appears to be that seasonal changes may cause an upswing in solar disturbances long after the peak in the solar cycle.\n\nResearchers can turn to advanced computer simulations and more detailed observations to learn more about the profound influence of the bands on solar activity.\n\nDr McIntosh said this could be assisted by a proposed network of satellites observing the sun, much as the global networks of satellites around Earth have helped advance terrestrial weather models since the 1960s.\n\n'If you understand what the patterns of solar activity are telling you, you'll know whether we're in the stormy phase or the quiet phase in each hemisphere,' Dr McIntosh said.\n\n'If we can combine these pieces of information, forecast skill goes through the roof.'", Scientists in Colorado have found evidence for a new solar season cycle. Every two years it appears 'bands' of magnetic field move to the surface. The sun was already known to have an 11-year solar cycle.

He was 71.\n\nCorliss died a week after suffering a major stroke, according to a tribute on Time's website by colleague Richard Zoglin, who called him ""perhaps the magazine's most quoted writer of all time.""\n\nUnlike some critics, Corliss appreciated all kinds of movies -- from the arty drama of Ingmar Bergman to the epic fantasy of ""The Lord of the Rings."" His all-TIME top 100 movies list, which he compiled with fellow Time critic Richard Schickel, contained everything from ""Pulp Fiction"" to ""Finding Nemo"" to Jackie Chan's ""Drunken Master II.""\n\n""He savored it all: the good, the bad, the indifferent. Except that he was indifferent to nothing,"" Zoglin wrote. ""To any fan or friend who would ask whether a new movie was 'worth seeing,' Corliss had a stock, succinct reply: 'Everything is worth seeing.' ""\n\nBut Corliss was not afraid to puncture hype around big movies he found overrated, including ""Titanic"" (""dead in the water"") and even -- blasphemy! -- ""Star Wars,"" about which he wrote, ""The movie's 'legs' will prove as vulnerable as C-3PO's.""\n\nHe also didn't care much for sentimental, uplifting movies that often become mainstream hits and win Oscars.\n\n""There are movies whose feel-good sentiments and slick craft annoy me so deeply that I know they will become box-office successes or top prizewinners,"" he once wrote. ""I call this internal mechanism my Built-In Hit Detector.""\n\nA graceful and prolific writer, Corliss reviewed more than 1,000 movies, penned many Time cover stories and authored four books on film, including ""Mom in the Movies: The Iconic Screen Mothers You Love (and a Few You Love to Hate),"" published just last year. (It was a partnership with Turner Classic Movies, which, like CNN, is owned by Turner Broadcasting.)\n\nSome credit him with coining the phrase ""drop-dead gorgeous"" to describe actress Michelle Pfeiffer in a review of her 1985 film, ""Into the Night.""\n\nHe also cleverly, and subtly, gave away the big plot spoiler of ""The Crying Game"" by spelling it out with the first letters of each paragraph of his review.\n\nBorn in Philadelphia, Corliss moved to New York after college and began writing film reviews for a variety of publications before joining Time in 1980. He served as editor of Film Comment, the movie journal of the Film Society of Lincoln Center, for 20 years, was a frequent guest on Charlie Rose's talk show and made annual pilgrimages to film festivals in Cannes, Toronto and Venice.\n\n""It's painful to try to find words, since Richard was such a master of them,"" Time editor Nancy Gibbs wrote in a note Friday to her staffers.\n\n""They were his tools, his toys, to the point that it felt sometimes as though he had to write, like the rest of us breathe and eat and sleep. It's not clear that Richard ever slept, for the sheer expanse of his knowledge and writing defies the normal contours of professional life.""\n\nHe is survived by his wife, Mary, a noted film critic in her own right, whom he married in 1969.\n\nPeople we've lost in 2015"," Veteran Time magazine film critic Richard Corliss died Thursday night in New York City.

It shows clumps of mystery particles across 0.4 per cent of the sky. The goal is to eventually map 12.5 per cent over five years. Red here shows more dark matter, and blue shows less. The moon is shown top left for scale\n\nA team from the University of Manchester, led by Dr Sarah Bridle, has spent the past two years measuring the shapes of galaxies used to construct the map.\n\nAnd the map was released today at the April meeting of the American Physical Society in Baltimore, Maryland.\n\nIt was created using data captured by the Dark Energy Camera, a 570-megapixel imaging device that is the primary instrument for the Dark Energy Survey (DES) led by Fermilab in the US.\n\nThe survey uses the 13ft (four metres) Victor M. Blanco Telescope located at the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory (CTIO) in Chile.\n\nWhen physicists study the dynamics of galaxies and the movement of stars, they are confronted with a mystery.\n\nIf they only take visible matter into account, their equations simply don't add up; the elements that can be observed are not sufficient to explain the rotation of objects and the existing gravitational forces. There is something missing.\n\nFrom this they deduced that there must be an invisible kind of matter that does not interact with light but does, as a whole, interact by means of the gravitational force.\n\nCalled 'dark matter', this substance appears to make up at least 80 per cent of the matter in the known universe. \n\nAnd the project is run overall as part of the five-year Dark Energy Survey (DES), and is the largest map of this detail.\n\nOf course, we can't actually directly observe dark matter yet - so the survey instead looks for its noticeable effect on galaxies.\n\nStudying this enables the predicted amounts of dark matter in a given area to be mapped, based on its gravitational effects. \n\n'Dark matter could equally be called ""transparent matter"", because we see things behind it that gets distorted by gravity,' Dr Bridle told MailOnline.\n\nIn the map she explained we're seeing about 150 times the area of the full moon, which is about 0.4 per cent of the whole sky.\n\nThe goal of the DES is to map 12.5 per cent of the entire sky, creating a 3D map of dark matter - and dark energy.\n\n'It is amazing to see a map of the dark matter over such a large region of the sky, and the full Dark Energy Survey mass map will be more than 30 times bigger still,' Dr Bridle said in a separate statement.\n\n'Analysis of the clumpiness of the dark matter in the maps will also allow us to probe the nature of the mysterious dark energy, believed to be causing the expansion of the universe to speed up.' \n\nThis mosaic image shows the different telescope shots that were combined to make the dark matter map. The survey has just completed its second year. As scientists expand their search they'll be able to better test current cosmological theories by comparing the amounts of dark and visible matter\n\nThe survey has just completed its second year. As scientists expand their search, they'll be able to better test current cosmological theories by comparing the amounts of dark and visible matter.\n\nThose theories suggest that, since there is much more dark matter in the universe than visible matter, galaxies will form where there are large concentrations of dark matter (and hence stronger gravity) present.\n\nSo far, the DES analysis backs this up. The maps show large filaments of matter along which visible galaxies and galaxy clusters lie and cosmic voids where very few galaxies reside.\n\nFollow-up studies of some of the enormous filaments and voids, and the enormous volume of data, collected throughout the survey will reveal more about this interplay of mass and light.\n\nThese maps show how the amount of dark matter corresponds to the formation rate of galaxies. On the left, galaxies can be seen near dark matter clumps (in red), and further away from sparse regions (blue). The image on the right shows some of the regions of sky that were studied\n\nThe team at Manchester analysed 130 million separate telescope images of galaxies to make the map.\n\nThe process of measuring the galaxies is so complex and time consuming that some of the world's largest supercomputers are needed to do it.\n\nEach time a new catalogue is made it takes about as much computing power as running 500 ordinary desktop computers for two weeks.\n\n'We have to measure the shape of each galaxy - how distorted it is - with extremely high precision, about one part in 1000,' said Dr Joe Zuntz, also of the University of Manchester, who has been making the measurements.\n\nThe survey uses the 13ft (four metres) Victor M. Blanco Telescope (middle) located at the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory (CTIO) in Chile, outfitted with a newly designed, state-of-the-art Dark Energy Camera (DECam). It will be completed by 2018, mapping dark matter of an eighth of the sky in the process\n\nDark matter, the mysterious substance that makes up 85 per cent of all matter in the universe, is invisible to even the most sensitive astronomical instruments because it does not emit or block light.\n\nBut its effects can be seen using a technique called gravitational lensing - studying the distortion that occurs when the gravitational pull of dark matter bends light around distant galaxies.\n\nUnderstanding how the clumpiness of dark matter changes with time will reveal the nature of the enigmatic dark energy, which is the ultimate goal of the survey.\n\nThe dark matter map released makes use of early DES observations and covers only about three percent of the area of sky DES will document over its five-year mission.", University of Manchester researchers reveal HD dark matter map. It shows clumps of mystery particles across 0.4 per cent of the sky. The goal is to eventually map 12.5 per cent over five years.

'Did you make mistakes?' \n\nThe usually garrulous and broad-smiling Clinton stared straight ahead, continued walking alongside her Secret Service and local police escorts, and said nothing.\n\nSCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO\n\nNO COMMENT: Hillary stared ahead and walked wordlessly Tuesday, refusing to acknowledge her first campaign-trail question about the deadly Benghazi terror attacks in 2012\n\nDEADLY: The September 11, 2012 Benghazi terror attacks killed four Americans including the US ambassador to Libya\n\nWRONG: Both President Barack Obama and then-Secretary of State Clinton incorrectly blamed the Benghazi attacks on protests sparked by a YouTube video mocking Islam's prophet Muhammad. The two are shown at a ceremony held to receive the remains of the four Americans who were killed at the scene\n\nMoments earlier, she answered a question about why her taxpayer-funded security detail had sped at 80 MPH past exits for the smaller Manchester, New Hampshire airport, and trekked all the way to Boston for a flight with first class seats.\n\n'You know, I don't make the travel arrangements. I don't,' Clinton said.\n\nThe Islamist terror group Ansar al-Shariah's military-style Benghazi attacks will likely be a thorn in Clinton's side throughout the 2016 presidential campaign season. \n\nThe group laid waste to a State Department facility while she was America's top diplomat.\n\nA special congressional committee chaired by South Carolina Republican Rep. Trey Gowdy, a former criminal prosecutor, has a mandate to investigate the episode through January 2017, making it unlikely that Clinton will be able to put the issue behind her.\n\nTROUBLE AHEAD: New Hampshire resident Brian Blackden included 'Benghazi blood' Tuesday on a sign listing reasons 'Hillary is a liar,' near the site of a Clinton appearance at the New Hampshire Technical Institute\n\nOn Sunday during a series of 50 brief interviews with Dartmouth College students in Hanover, New Hampshire, 22 of them made references to Bengahzi when asked about Clinton's chances of becoming president.\n\nMany of them, like freshman Cameron Poole, weren't old enough to drive when it happened.\n\n'I think there was blood on her hands,' Poole told Daily Mail Online.\n\nHe said he believes Clinton's performance before, during and after should disqualify her from holding higher office.\n\n'I definitely do,' he said. 'It shows how she acts under pressure.'\n\nNOT FORGOTTEN: U.S. Ambassader the Libya Chris Stevens was the first to die in Benghazi, and was seen by Libyans as a moderate – angering anti-American hardliners from radical Islamist groups\n\nCASUALTIES: US Foreign Service Information Management Officer Sean Smith (left), US Navy SEAL Glen Doherty (center) and US Nacy SEAL Tyrone Woods (right) perished in the Ansar al-Shariah attacks in Benghazi\n\nFour Americans lost their lives in the September 11, 2012 terror attacks, including U.S. Ambassador to Libya Christopher Stevens, the first American ambassador killed while on duty since 1979.\n\nU.S. Foreign Service Information Management Officer Sean Smith also perished in the initial barrage of mortars and automatic weapons fire. \n\nHours later, a second wave of attacks hit a CIA annex compound nearby, killing CIA contract soldiers Tyrone Woods and Glen Doherty, both U.S. Navy SEALs.\n\nThe four men came home in flag-draped caskets.\n\nCongressional Republicans want answers about Clinton's involvement in what they see as a potential cover-up of facts surrounding how the attacks unfolded and why – and how the Obama administration explained it afterward, just weeks before an election.\n\nPart of the swirling controversy involves a home-brew email server that Clinton exclusively used for her official electronic communications while she was secretary of state.\n\nClinton never used an official 'state-dot-gov' email address, but told reporters on March 10 that she had given the State Department copes of 'official' emails – and acknowledged deciding herself which ones qualified.\n\nShe deleted the rest, some 32,000 messages in all.\n\nClinton's attorney has refused to hand over the server to congressional investigators. Gowdy, the Benghazi committee chairman, wants a neutral third-party to examine it and determine if Benghazi-related emails can be recovered.\n\nHis committee said Wednesday that its report on the Benghazi attacks won't likely be finished until 2016, putting its release squarely in the middle of the presidential campaign's most hotly contested months.\n\nBut the committee said in a statement that 'Secretary Clinton's decision to seek the presidency of the United States does not and will not impact the work of the committee.'\n\nClinton's State Department infamously declined to provide her Benghazi outpost with the beefed-up security presence its station chief requested in the weeks preceding the deadly Ansar al-Shariah attacks.\n\nShe claimed later that she never saw the requests, insisting that such routine diplomatic cables would never have made it to her desk, even if they were addressed to her.\n\nFIRST CLASS: Hillary (seated at the front, right) traveled in luxury from Boston to Washington, seated next to chief of staff Huma Abedin, after am 80 MPH Secret Service dash to Logan International Airport\n\nFAREWELL: Hillary Clinton waved at the end of her final campaign stop in New Hampshire on Tuesday, before hitting the road to Boston for the same Washington-bound flight that Daily Mail Online flew on\n\nIn the days following the attacks, Clinton said publicly that it was the result of a spontaneous protest over a YouTube video made by an American – a film that insulted the Islamic prophet Muhammad.\n\nSuch protests were seen in other Muslim countries, but U.S. intelligence determined in real-time that the Benghazi attacks were well-organized and easily traced back to an Islamist terror network.\n\nMonths later, following a concussion that delayed her congressional testimony about Benghazi, she testified in a U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing.\n\nJust days earlier, lawmakers disclosed that a top U.S. diplomat told them 'everyone' at the American diplomatic outpost in Benghazi knew 'from the beginning' that they were in the middle of a terrorist attack.\n\n'The fact is we had four dead Americans,' Clinton told the senators. 'Was it because of a protest or was it because of guys out for a walk one night who decided that they'd they go kill some Americans?'\n\n'What difference at this point does it make?'"," Former secretary of state landed Tuesday night at Washington Reagan National Airport after a first-class flight from Boston. Clinton stared ahead wordlessly, walked and didn't acknowledge questions as Daily Mail Online asked whether she had made mistakes in Benghazi. Deadly attacks, carried out by an affiliate of al Qaeda, claimed the lives of U.S. Ambassador to Libya Chris Stevens and three other US personnel. Special congressional committee  investigating circumstances before and after the attacks; its report will come out during 2016 presidential campaign. Questions remain about Clinton's alleged failure to protect her diplomatic outpost, and the reasons she cited for the debacle after four flag-draped caskets came home. U.S. intelligence knew at the time that Benghazi personnel were aware they were under attack, but Clinton and other Obama administration officials blamed an out-of-control protest linked to an anti-Islam YouTube video .",['•[by an affiliate of al Qaeda] added info. \\n\\n•thorough and elaborate summary.

I turned my phone off and was away myself, away out on the bike with plenty of thinking time: a great freedom of mind.\n\n'I was that sick of what has been going on in Scottish football I was seriously contemplating my own future. I'm serious when I say that.\n\n'I had just had it up to here and was ready to just give it up. If it wasn't for what happened when I turned my phone back on, with the phone calls and texts I received from people I really value in football, that my spirits picked up again.\n\n'The calls and texts came in from all over the place, from some of the highest levels across the game. I've had phone calls that have really got me back on my feet.\n\n'I wouldn't like to name them all, but there were a lot of good people and a good few close friends in the football fraternity. \n\nMeekings was not sent off and no penalty was given as Inverness went on to beat Celtic 3-2 after extra-time \n\n'They were saying: ""You need to lead from the front, you need to fight it."" That restored and galvanised that focus and drive in me. And, if that was how I was feeling, how was the boy Josh Meekings feeling? It should never have come to this.'\n\nMeekings was cleared to play in the final by the Judicial Panel yesterday, but Hughes insists this 'unprecedented' SFA wrangle must be the catalyst for change in Scottish football's governance.\n\nAlthough those who sit on the panel are drawn from many walks of life, ranging from former players and coaches to ex-refs and members of the legal profession, Hughes said he wants 'real football people' drafted in instead of the 'suits' he claims lack understanding of the nuances and spirit of the professional game.\n\nAnd he seemed to point a thinly-veiled finger of accusation at SFA chief executive Stewart Regan by alleging that compliance officer Tony McGlennan was a mere 'patsy' in the process.\n\nOverwhelmed by a huge upswell of support for Meekings, he said: 'No disrespect to those sitting on [the judicial panel], but you need football guys and that's where it's flawed. That's why I promised myself I'd never go back down there until that gets sorted out.\n\n'The last time I appeared was when I was down at Livingston. It was quite galling. You have to be qualified in what you're judging on. There's no one better qualified than ex-players and ex-coaches. For some reason the SFA don't want to go down that line. Why?\n\n'I couldn't tell you who I sat in front of while at Livingston, but they weren' t football people. I'm talking about playing the game, managing the game, coaching the game.\n\nJohn Hughes was ready to walk away from his post and the games he loves\n\n'There are hundreds of these guys I'm quite sure would go in there and do it, for the sake of football. We need to use this to make sure the whole process work better. Josh's case was unprecedented. How was that? Somebody needs to explain that to me.\n\n'I know the verdict has gone in our favour but I don't think this is finished. We need to sit down and look at the Judicial Panel process.\n\n'I don't believe in the Panel. I promised myself a couple of years ago I wouldn' t walk back into Hampden until it changes. I would never question their integrity but I want football people sitting in judgment.\n\n'They are making a football decision and I want football people. Look at what is at stake. Here we were talking about a young player's chance of playing in a Scottish Cup final. I'd be more confident with football people because they know the game.\n\n'The compliance officer is damned if he does, damned if doesn't. Is he getting used as a patsy in all this? I honestly don't know.\n\n'How far do you take it? We're opening a whole can of worms here. We had a strong claim for a penalty when the goalkeeper comes through the back of Edward Ofere. Where do you draw the line?\n\n'It's unheard of, but I honestly think there's a little bit more to it. We can use this whole episode to make it better.'\n\nHughes, who accepted Meekings would have warranted a red card had the ref spotted the offence, refused to point a finger of blame at former club Celtic for the letter of complaint they wrote to the SFA in the aftermath.\n\n'Celtic keep getting flung into it, but I came in here this morning and all Kristine, our receptionist, says to me is that the phone had never stopped ringing with Celtic supporters wishing Josh all the best and hoping he plays in the final.\n\n'I believe that comes right from the top at Celtic. They conduct themselves in a great manner. I had the privilege to play for that club and everything they do is class.\n\n'What I will say is, in Scotland, we put people up on a pedestal. We love it. It's our character. And we love knocking them down again.\n\n'But see when there has been an injustice, one thing we do in Scotland is show a real solidarity to make sure we get it right.\n\n'That's what I'm finding about the whole of Scottish football in the reaction to this. There's a real coming together as they all recognise this is not right.\n\n'I have to be the voice of Inverness. I'm not really saying [all] that I really want to say. I'm trying to be calculated and honest. I think there's more to say. There's more to it.'"," Inverness defender Josh Meekings has won appeal against one-match ban.

I thought once, 'Somebody will be the last person and what if it's Da-yun?'"" Park said.\n\nA year later, Park's life remains at a standstill. Nine have yet to be found.\n\n""We, the families of the missing victims, are still living the day --  April 16, 2014,"" said Park, who is in poor health, but refusing treatment. ""I cannot think about anything except to find my daughter and other missing people.""\n\nPark's case is an unsettling one -- emblematic of what remains unresolved a year after the Sewol ferry sank. Dozens associated with the ferry disaster have been sent to jail on criminal charges. But families say the underlying problems that led to the sinking of the Sewol are far from resolved.\n\nOn April 16, the Sewol ferry, carrying hundreds of high school students, began sinking after taking a sharp turn.\n\nPassengers were told repeatedly by the crew members to stay where they were as rescuers would arrive soon. Many of them listened to the instructions and remained in place. As the ferry tilted sideways, water seeped in and objects in the ship toppled over, injuring people and blocking their way out.\n\nAnger over how the crew failed to evacuate the passengers intensified when video surfaced of the ferry's captain in his underwear leaping into the arms of the Korean Coast Guard while hundreds remained trapped in the vessel.\n\nDivers had to pluck the bodies from the water one-by-one, bringing the youngsters back to land in black body bags where they were met with the gut-wrenching cries of their families.\n\nOn Thursday, the one year anniversary of the disaster, South Korea's President Park Geun-hye called for the salvage of the Sewol's wreck ""as soon as possible.""\n\n""Recently, there was an announcement that it is technically possible to salvage Sewol ferry. I believe that it is now time to earnestly prepare to salvage,"" she said.\n\nA government study on raising the ferry released last week identified a crane and floating dock as the safest way to look for the missing. The Sewol ferry is over 20 years old and there are fears it could fall apart during the extraction, according to the South Korean Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries.\n\nThe agency anticipates a complicated technical operation to remove the ferry, which would weigh about 10,200 tons above water. The process could take over a year and a half, and that it would cost the South Korean government anywhere from $91 million to $182 million.\n\nThe victims' families have demanded that the ship be recovered in order to thoroughly investigate the accident.\n\nSince the days immediately after the disaster, families have criticized the government over its response. Communication over the rescue efforts were jumbled, paving way for rumors and hoaxes. Criticism swirled over the South Korean Coast Guard's effectiveness in carrying out the rescue operation.\n\nThe captain of the first coast guard ship sent to rescue the Sewol passengers was found guilty of negligence and making false reports.\n\nThe recovery efforts have also taken a deadly toll with a total of six deaths -- a diver searching the Sewol died in May, and in July, five people died after a helicopter carrying emergency workers involved in the operation crashed.\n\nPark, the South Korean president, pledged major reforms, dismantled the coast guard and vowed an investigation into what went wrong. That promised investigation has been hampered by politics and disagreements between the families and the government over who should participate in the investigation.\n\nEarlier this month, several dozens of family members marched to Seoul from Ansan, the suburb where most of the students had resided. Some of the families shaved their heads to demand political action.\n\nSeveral laws have been passed to inspect cargo weight and increase oversight in the industry.\n\nIn the case of Sewol, the ferry was found to be loaded with double its capacity. Its cargo wasn't secured properly, which threw the ship off balance as the containers tumbled and knocked the vessel off balance. An inexperienced crew and redesigns of the ship to handle more passengers and cargo were also cited as factors in the disaster.\n\nThe sinking spurred a debate about the shortcomings of the government and what preventive measures should have been taken.\n\n""The tragedy of Sewol was also virtually caused by accumulation of corruption, irregularity and going blind eyes,"" Park said on Thursday. ""Corruption and deep-rooted evil are issues that can lead to taking away people's lives. We take this very seriously.""\n\nIn the immediate aftermath, South Korean prosecutors arrested the captain, crew members and business associates.\n\nSewol's captain, Lee Joon-seok, who was widely derided for jumping to safety, was sentenced to 36 years in prison for abandonment causing death and injury, and violating sea laws.\n\nIn July, the body of a billionaire Yoo Byung Eun, who was believed to have connections to the company that owned the ferry, was found decomposing in a plum field.\n\nBut some families say that wider, systematic problems that allowed the disaster to occur haven't been addressed.  Whether the ferry will be raised and an independent investigation will be held remains to be seen.\n\nCNN's KJ Kwon and journalist Jungeun Kim contributed to this report in Seoul."," Sewol ferry sank a year ago off the coast of South Korea, killing 304 people. Families hold protests, vigils, say not much has been resolved since sinking. Government has yet to decide whether to raise the ferry.","['The summary is missing a couple of main points of the article.

I jump at the chance to experience new flavours and gather fresh inspiration.\n\nAnd where better to tickle your tastebuds than in glorious Grenada?\n\nThe island is known for its zesty spices and self-sufficiency - the only food it imports is milk.\n\nHeading west: Rosemary spent a week on Grenada, where fresh foodstuffs like cocoa fruit are easily available\n\nMeat and fish are plentiful and, because the soil is very fertile, the vegetables, fruit and salads are the glossiest you'll ever see.\n\nGrenada's seasons are similar to our own, which means cauliflower, broccoli and pumpkins in spring.\n\nExotic fruit - mangoes, star fruit, passion fruit, melon and skin-up, which is like a lychee — are the stars of the summer.\n\nAutumn heralds guavas, sweetsop (sugar apples) and soursop (similar to pawpaw), and then there is the temptingly named mammee apple, which is a Caribbean version of a peach.\n\nSumptuous sands: Grenada is home to splendid beaches - such as the glorious arc of Grand Anse\n\nI am staying in the southwest of the island at Mount Cinnamon on Grand Anse Beach, near the charming town of St George.\n\nIt offers well-equipped self-catering villas, each with its own terrace and wonderful views of the bay.\n\nYou can cook your own supper, but the bubbling restaurant scene is difficult to resist.\n\nBeach bars abound. I especially liked the Beach Cabana at Mount Cinnamon, where they serve fabulously strong cocktails made with local rum at all hours of the day and night.\n\nPeople come across from nearby islands to enjoy the weekly bonfire on the beach, at which local musicians play. This is the Caribbean at its best. Just beware of those generous drinks measures.\n\nThe restaurant Yolo (which is text speakfor 'you only live once') specialises in sushi and Asian cuisine.\n\nI order plums, mangoes, cherries and avocados, all picked that day. The fish is as fresh as can be - so the tuna tartare, its signature dish, almost leaps off the plate.\n\nCome dine with me: Grenada is an island awash with fresh produce and intriguing local recipes\n\nThe next day, I watch a fish cookery demonstration at Mount Cinnamon: a traditional dish of kingfish marinated in coconut, ginger, lime, spices, peppers and chives, wrapped in banana leaves and cooked over a wood fire, and served with delicious breadfruit chips.\n\nIf you want to mingle with Grenadans, there is nowhere better than a rambunctious food market. St George's market brims with local spices and everything else that is grown on the island.\n\nIn a 17th-century working plantation - a colonial house and estate - you can witness the crops of fruit, exotic flowers and spices in their regimented glory.\n\nHere, I learn to cook the Grenadan national dish, oil down. This is a hearty, one-pot meal with salted meat, chicken, breadfruit, callaloo - which is like spinach - and dumplings. The whole lot is stewed in coconut milk. Delicious!\n\nThe food odyssey continues in the evening when I visit BB's Crabback Caribbean restaurant, overlooking the harbour.\n\nMy favourite place to eat on the beach is La Sagesse, on its own strip of sand from which you can swim in a bath-temperature sea.\n\nA place to cool your heels: Rosemary stayed at Grenada's elegant Mount Cinnamon resort\n\nNo tour of the island would be complete without a visit to the River Antione Rum Distillery - the last one in the Caribbean to make the drink from cane sugar, as they did in the 18th century.\n\nRum is not to my taste, but it's interesting to see the process behind it.\n\nBelmont in the Grand Etang area is more to my liking. It's a fully functioning plantation and organic farm. We taste goat's cheese and salt fish fritters, a popular local dish.\n\nEven the governor grows her own vegetables.\n\nHer Excellency Dame Cecile la Grenade is the first woman governor on the island. She received an OBE from the Queen for the food business started by her mother.\n\nHer extensive gardens are full of exotic vegetables, fruit and spices — a dream to any aspiring cook. Even the paths are made of crushed nutmeg shells.\n\nA fitting tribute to this fragrant and friendly island.\n\nBritish Airways (0844 493 0787, www.ba.com) flies to Grenada from £562 return.\n\nA one-bedroom suite at the Mount Cinnamon hotel resort & beach club (001 473 439 4400, www.mountcinnamongrenadahotel.com) starts from £265 B&B per night."," Grenada is known as the 'Island of Spice', and is full of foodie flavours.

But recently there has been disagreement about regular screening for women in their 40s.\n\nStudy authors Mei-Sing Ong, a research fellow at Boston Children's Hospital, and Kenneth Mandl, a professor at Harvard Medical School, say their findings indicate that the cost of breast cancer overtreatment appears to be much higher than previously estimated. \n\nTheir $4bn figure is the midpoint of a range that depends upon assumptions about the rates of false-positive mammograms and breast cancer overdiagnosis.\n\nApart from the financial cost of screening tests and treatment, false positives and overdiagnosis expose women to risks from additional medical procedures, not to mention psychological distress. \n\nIt is not uncommon for mammograms to turn up some apparent abnormality that has to be resolved with more imaging tests or a biopsy.\n\n'We're hoping that the financial cost of this problem will help cast into greater relief the human cost,' said  Mandl. \n\n'The two messages together are powerful. The fact that this is not only a problem, but a very costly problem we hope will accelerate the attempts to try to fix the screening practices.'\n\nBut another expert defended those practices, and called the study one-sided.\n\n'There was no attempt to balance the costs with the benefits,' said Richard Wender, who heads prevention, detection and patient-support efforts at the American Cancer Society. \n\n'I strongly feel that every study that looks at the downsides of any screening test has to be balanced with the benefits.'\n\nThe American Cancer Society recommends yearly mammograms for women starting at 40, while a government advisory group - the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force - recommends that regular screening begins at 50.\n\nThe study found that women aged 40 and 49 were more likely to have a false-positive mammogram, compared to women in their 50s.\n\nEarly detection: Annual mammograms starting at 40 years old have long been considered standard for preventive care, because cancer is easier to treat if detected early\n\nThe American Cancer Society recommends yearly mammograms for women starting at 40, while a government advisory group says regular screening should begin at 50\n\nWender questioned the assumptions behind the new study, saying that the authors made a 'very selective choice of estimates' for the rates of false positives and overdiagnosis.\n\n'There is no debate about the benefits of mammography,' he said.\n\nMandl responded that the assumptions in his study are supported by other research, and that by definition there is no medical benefit to mammograms that produce false-positive results.\n\nThe study was based on billing data from a major U.S. insurer, including more than 700,000 women aged between 40 and 59 in all 50 states, from 2011 through 2013.\n\nThe U.S. spends much more on healthcare than any other country, but lags behind other economically advanced societies on life expectancy and certain other health indicators. \n\nThat has prompted strong interest among insurers, employers and government officials in comparing the effectiveness of competing treatments, tests and medications.\n\nCancer treatment may end up being one of the most closely followed issues in the broader debate over healthcare costs and benefits. \n\nA different study also published in Monday's Health Affairs found that cancer death rates were lower in countries that spent more on cancer care, and that countries that increased spending the most made more progress in reducing death rates.", Study estimates yearly figure for women aged 40-59.

She had significant financial responsibility but defrauded the school and thereby the community.'\n\nMs Knight told the court that cowboy builder Lee Slocombe had carried out £80,000 worth of work at Harkin's home in Pontypridd over an 18-month period from November 2012.\n\nLabelled a fraudster and a conman who swindled thousands from victims, Slocombe was jailed for 43 months earlier this year for fraud.\n\nIn total, Harkin signed six cheques to Slocombe over a six-month period.\n\nIn August 2013, she gave him a cheque for £6,720, which she claimed in the school books was for a gazebo at Llwyncelyn School, but the cheque bounced as there was no second signatory.\n\nShe signed another one in September of the same year for £5,000, which was cashed at Cash Converters, in Aberdare, by one of Slocombe's employees.\n\nSince there was no second signatory on that one either, staff phoned the school and spoke to Harkin.\n\n'She said the cheque was genuine and that it could be drawn,' said Ms Knight.\n\n'She tried to fob school staff off when they asked her about it saying it was nothing to do with the school.' \n\nIn total, Harkin (left) signed six cheques to cowboy builder Lee Slocombe (right) totalling £30,000. She 'dabbled' in school funds while headteacher of the primary, a position she had held for nine years\n\nMs Knight said the bank refused to honour the cheque leaving Cash Converters out of pocket, forcing them to pursue a civil claim.\n\nLocal authority auditors spoke to Harkin in the autumn and she claimed the cheque was a holding cheque for work to be done in October half-term.\n\nThe auditor concluded it was an isolated incident and put it down to her naivety and inexperience.\n\n'It was the first trigger in the local authority to indicate something was amiss,' said Ms Knight.\n\nIn November 2013, Harkin moved to Coedpenmaen Primary School in Pontypridd and in December wrote a cheque for £5,000 for a shelter at Llwyncelyn.\n\nThe bank refused to honour it but Slocombe took it to Abermarle Bond pawnbrokers in Cardiff, which cashed £2,500 on the basis he would return to get the rest. He never did.\n\nHarkin issued another £5,000 cheque later that month, which Slocombe partially cashed.\n\nShe then issued a further three cheques on the same day on January 3 last year, one for £5,000, which was rejected by the bank and another, which was not presented.\n\nThe last cheque, for £3,200, Harkin actually took into a Porth bank herself to cash after forging the signature of the deputy head, Susan Jones.\n\n'The defendant was seen making that transaction on CCTV,' said Ms Knight.\n\n'The cheques were signed during the school holidays because she knew there would be no likelihood of being caught by staff.'\n\nSlocombe carried out £80,000 worth of work at Harkin's home in Pontypridd (pictured), which she shares with her bank manager husband Anthony and their two children, over an 18-month period from November 2012\n\nSlocombe  was jailed earlier this year for 43 months for fraud for swindling money from dozens of victims. Pictured: Rubble and building materials remain outside Harkin's family property in Pontypridd, Wales\n\nHarkin was called into a special meeting on January 21 last year and challenged about the irregularities.\n\nThat led to a criminal investigation and Harkin admitted five counts of fraud and one each of theft and forgery.\n\nShe told officers that she knew she should not have 'dabbled' in school funds.\n\nMarion Lewis, defending, said: 'It is a tragedy to see a woman of her calibre before the criminal court in such serious offences as these.\n\nShe knows the effect her actions have had on the school and deeply regrets them.\n\n'The effects of her wrongdoing have been devastating. A successful career that she dearly loved has been destroyed. She is thoroughly ashamed.\n\n'She came under Lee Slocombe's spell. He charmed her. Her eyes were not opened until she was confronted with the fact that he had pleaded guilty to offences of fraud.\n\n'She has found it very difficult to come to terms with her own gullibility and feels completely humiliated.' \n\nMerthyr Tydfil Crown Court heard that not only did Harkin use the chequebook of Llwyncelyn Primary School (pictured) when she was headteacher there, but she also continued to use it when she moved schools\n\nMs Lewis asked for any sentence to be suspended but Judge Richard Twomlow refused her plea and jailed Harkin for 12 months.\n\nHe told her: 'Not only were you responsible for writing the cheques but you were helping to try to get them cashed from the school account.\n\n'You forged a cheque. Someone else was being dragged in as well as the school to this fraudulent project.\n\n'There were no sufficient funds in the account and there was a risk that the cheques would be cashed making the school account go overdrawn.\n\n'Lee Slocombe may be a fraudster and a plausible man but he was doing work at your house. You must have known that the last thing you were entitled to do was to use school funds to try to help him.\n\n'This was a repeated and persistent breach of a high degree of trust. The school account never had much in it but that did not stop you from trying to access them with varying degrees of success through your own selfish needs because of your feelings for a man who told you he needed money.\n\n'These were deliberate and calculated frauds.

A magma chamber beneath the surface is not considered large enough to produce these levels and now researchers have found the source in a secondary magma chamber deeper underground\n\nThe Yellowstone supervolcano is one of the largest active continental silicic volcanic fields in the world. Silicic is used to describe magma or igneous rock rich in silica.\n\nIt is situated in Yellowstone National Park - which spans the midwestern US states of Wyoming, Idaho and Montana - and last erupted 640,000 years ago. \n\nThe Yellowstone supervolcano is one of the largest active continental silicic volcanic fields in the world. \n\nIt is situated in Yellowstone National Park - which spans the midwestern US states of Wyoming, Idaho and Montana - and last erupted 640,000 years ago.\n\nAlthough lava has flowed in the area as recently as 70,000 years ago, the researchers said.\n\nExperts say there is a one in 700,000 annual chance of a volcanic eruption at the site. \n\nPrevious research found a relatively small magma chamber, known as the upper-crustal magma reservoir, directly beneath the surface in 2013 that measures 2,500 cubic miles (10,420 cubic km). \n\nTo discover the latest chamber, Hsin-Hua Huang from the University of Utah and colleagues  tracked seismic waves from almost 5,000 earthquakes.\n\nThe researchers said the reservoir contains around 98 per cent hot rock.\n\nThe remaining 2 per cent is molten rock and is too deep to directly cause an eruption. \n\nIt sits 12 to 28 miles (19 to 45km) beneath the supervolcano and measures 11,035 cubic miles (46,000 cubic km). \n\nLava has flowed in the area as recently as 70,000 years ago, researchers added.\n\nExperts say there is a one in 700,000 annual chance of a volcanic eruption at the site. \n\nPrevious research found a relatively small magma chamber, known as the upper-crustal magma reservoir, directly beneath the surface in 2013 that measures 2,500 cubic miles (10,420 cubic km). \n\nTo discover the latest chamber, Hsin-Hua Huang from the University of Utah and his colleagues  tracked seismic waves from almost 5,000 earthquakes.\n\nThese readings combined data from the University of Utah Seismograph Stations, which collected shallow readings from nearby quakes in Utah, Idaho, the Teton Range and Yellowstone, and from the Earthscope array, which revealed deeper readings from temblors from more further afield.\n\nEach of these quakes created waves that echoed around the supervolcano. \n\nThe movement and structure of these waves could then be used to map the earth beneath. \n\nThe researchers said in their paper: 'The Yellowstone magmatic system from the mantle plume to the upper crust', published in the journal Science, that the reservoir contains around 98 per cent hot rock. \n\nThe remaining two per cent is molten rock and is too deep to directly cause an eruption, they added.\n\nIt sits 12 to 28 miles (19 to 45km) beneath the supervolcano and measures 11,035 cubic miles (46,000 cubic km).\n\nTo put this into perspective, the Grand Canyon in Arizona has a volume of 1,000 cubic miles (4,168 cubic km) meaning the molten rock in the upper chamber would fill it two-and-a-half times, and the rock from the larger lower chamber would fill it 11 times. \n\nPrevious research found a relatively small magma chamber, known as the upper-crustal magma reservoir, beneath the surface in 2013 that measures 2,500 cubic miles (10,420 cubic km).

Each of these quakes created waves that 'echoed' around the supervolcano. The smaller magma chamber is shown in red beneath the supervolcano's caldera \n\nResearchers said the upper magma chamber is believed to have been the source of three Yellowstone eruptions 2 million, 1.2 million and 640,000 years ago. \n\nIf Yellowstone did erupt, estimates from a National Geographic report said its immediate effects would kill around 87,000 instantly.\n\nA 10-foot (3 metre) layer of ash would travel around 1,000 miles (1,610km), leaving two-thirds of the US uninhabitable.\n\nThis spread of volcanic ash, rocks and gas would then prevent planes from taking off and disrupt air travel around the globe. \n\nNot only do the findings reveal what is causing the high levels of carbon dioxide, researchers can use it to learn more about how the supervolcano connects to the hot-spot plume in Earth's mantle. \n\nIt could also provide clues about the structure of other supervolcanoes. \n\n'An understanding of its properties is key to enhancing our knowledge of volcanic mechanisms and corresponding risk,' said the researchers. \n\n'This lower-crustal magma body has a volume 4.5 times larger than the upper-crustal magma reservoir [and] these estimates are critical to understanding the evolution of basaltic-rhyolitic volcanism and explaining the magnitude of CO2 discharge.'\n\nThe presence of magma reservoirs underlying upper crust magma chambers has been inferred at other locations, but not detected. \n\nThe paper added that the upper magma chamber is believed to have been the source of three Yellowstone eruptions 2 million, 1.2 million and 640,000 years ago. \n\nThe Yellowstone supervolcano is one of the largest active continental silicic volcanic fields in the world.

After a firestorm of backlash and protests, Gov. Mike Pence said on Tuesday that the state will ""fix"" the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, or RFRA, so it will not discriminate against gays and lesbians.\n\nPence is making the right call. Promoting the false dichotomy between protecting religion versus protecting equality serves no one. Not all people who dislike the law hate religion, and not all people who like the law want to discriminate against the LGBT community. If people of good will come together, liberty and equality can both be saved.\n\nThe unbelievably easy way to fix Indiana's RFRA is to add one small amendment, one easy line codifying that discrimination against the LGBT community is harmful, and that there is a compelling governmental interest in eliminating that harm.\n\nIn general, it is a good thing for society to shape its laws in ways that allow people to live their lives consistent with their sincerely held religious obligations. As Americans, we value and always have valued the freedom and expression of religion.\n\nSometimes, a law seems to impose only modest burdens on the people it affects, but in practice it actually severely burdens the religious practices of a few. In those situations, if there is no compelling governmental interest in enforcing that law in that particularly burdensome way -- and if no one else is harmed -- then religion should be granted an exemption.\n\nShifting the burden to the government to prove that it really does need to apply this law in this particular way will not allow every person to become a law unto themselves; it simply sends the message that religion is important, and unless there are specific and compelling reasons why, people should be allowed to practice as they need.\n\nThese are the reasons why the federal RFRA was passed in 1993, and why it had bipartisan support. These are wholesome American values that everyone can get behind. The problem is that we no longer live in 1993, 10 years before Lawrence v. Texas, and 20 before U.S. v. Windsor. In 1993, our sensibilities were different; there was not yet a national conversation about the need to protect the rights and dignity of members of the LGBT community.\n\nTiming matters because society changes, and now that our horizons have been broadened we cannot just keep insisting that the law was never intended to discriminate and worked just fine 22 years ago, before we realized its negative potential.\n\nEven if not a single lawmaker consciously intends the bill to be used as a shield for discrimination, we still have to take seriously Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes' claim about unintended consequences.\n\nTo put it simply, you have to be concerned with what the law allows a person to get away with. The concern is real. Because Indiana does not have a law prohibiting discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, the bill as drafted might allow people who were so inclined to discriminate, and simply assert that they could do so based on a religious belief.\n\nPublic perceptions matter. Whether or not lawmakers think so, it certainly seems relevant to the general public that this bill was passed with important national decisions about marriage equality on the horizon and right after the ruling in Baskin v. Bogans that Indiana's same-sex marriage ban was unconstitutional.\n\nWriting for the Seventh Circuit panel in 2014, Judge Richard Posner's rationale in the case of Baskin v. Bogan provides the obvious answer for how to fix the RFRA deficiency without changing what it is that it defends. Courts have long held that a religious exemption cannot be granted if it allows you to shift the harm to a third party, and -- as Posner explained so simply -- discrimination is harmful.\n\nRFRAs are not inherently evil. The message can be nondiscriminatory and religion can be protected. The principles of RFRA can remain unchanged; it is just the definition of harmful that evolves.\n\nA few simple words have the potential to completely change the conversation, send an important message about the value of equality, and make Indiana into a shining beacon of cooperation: the real ""crossroads of America."" Doing so would go a long way toward restoring its reputation as a place of great opportunity for all to live and worship and work."," Gov. Mike Pence is making the right call to fix Indiana's religious freedom law, which can be used for discrimination.

Even after closing arguments, the motive is still unclear but not legally required to get a conviction. Still, jurors like to know a motive.\n\nEvidence collected in Lloyd's death led to two more murder charges against Hernandez in a separate case in Boston. It's scheduled to begin in May, but officials say it will be pushed back.\n\nThe trial has involved a complicated cast of characters, including two sisters who played important roles in the lives of Hernandez and Lloyd\n\nHere is a primer:\n\nInside the case against Aaron Hernandez\n\nOdin Lloyd\n\nOdin Lloyd was a 27-year-old semi-pro football player for the Boston Bandits.  He was found dead on June 17, 2013, less than a mile from Hernandez's home in North Attleboro, Massachusetts. He had been shot six times. Lloyd met Hernandez while dating Shaneah Jenkins, the sister of Hernandez's fiancee, Shayanna Jenkins. Hernandez is charged with orchestrating Lloyd's execution.\n\nDaniel de Abreu and Safiro Furtado\n\nDaniel de Abreu and Safiro Furtado were killed outside a Boston nightclub on July 16, 2012. Earlier that evening, prosecutors say, de Abreu accidentally bumped into Hernandez, spilling a drink.  Later that night, Hernandez was driving an SUV and allegedly pulled up alongside de Abreu and Furtado's car near the nightclub and fired a .38-caliber revolver at them, killing them. The trial judge in the Lloyd case barred any mention of the Boston deaths, ruling it would be prejudicial.\n\nAlexander Bradley\n\nAuthorities say  Alexander Bradley is Hernandez's former right hand man  who was allegedly with Hernandez  on the night de Abreu and Furtado were killed. He is not facing any charges in that case, but he is jailed on unrelated charges. He is suing Hernandez for allegedly shooting him in the face in February 2013, four months before Lloyd's death. Bradley says Hernandez accused him of ""disrespecting him"" over a cell phone left in a Miami strip club.  Bradley testified against Hernandez in Lloyd's death, telling jurors he saw Hernandez handling what appeared to be a Glock semi-automatic pistol during a trip to Florida. The trial barred him from saying he accused Hernandez of shooting him in the face.\n\nCarlos Ortiz\n\nCarlos Ortiz, nicknamed Charlie Boy, is also charged with murder in the death of Lloyd and has pleaded not guilty.

It is very difficult to do it every year - but every two years you must do it.\n\n'I'm not just talking about Manchester City. You see Real Madrid, Manchester United, Chelsea, Barcelona and Bayern Munich - all the big clubs - they all do it. It is important to have big names.'\n\nGiven the general disappointments of last summer's principle signings - Fernando, Bacary Sagna and Eliaquim Mangala - Pellegrini's words could be perceived as a plea for more cash.\n\nBut when pushed further, Pellegrini, perhaps not surprisingly given that his own position could be uncertain, would not say whether a spending spree might be sanctioned.\n\nPellegrini still believes his Manchester City side are capable of retaining the Premier Legaue title\n\nHe said: 'I don't want to talk about (plans) for next season because we have to finish this season. It is very important the way we finish this season before we analyse all the players. So it is not the right moment to talk about it.'\n\nPellegrini's immediate concern is his side's league position. Results elsewhere have seen City drop two places over the weekend and, although Pellegrini has not given up on the title, he clearly cannot even take the runners-up spot for granted.\n\nHe said: 'Well we are not thinking about just one team. I think it is important for our team to finish at the top of the table but if we can't win the Premier League then we must try to be second.\n\n'But it is important to play from now until the end of the season in a way that shows you are an important team and are prepared to fight until the last game to try and retain the title.'"," Manuel Pellegrini believes Man City need to sign a world class superstar.

'Probably the Easter before.'\n\nMore than a few of the fans lugging around similar equipment were, like Watson — who made the two-hour drive from Macon — experiencing Augusta National in person for the first time.\n\nMost just planned to mosey around until something caught their fancy. Some had general targets in mind — a favorite player or two, the trio of back-nine holes reverentially dubbed 'Amen Corner,' or the gigantic manual scoreboard alongside the first fairway.\n\nThen there was the occasional experienced big-game hunter, decked out with camera bags and an array of lenses.\n\n'I'm after Phil Mickelson,' said Kim McNeeley of nearby Aiken, South Carolina.

'That's usually for family events.'\n\nFans photograph Tiger Woods on their cell phones during a practice round for the World Golf Championships-Bridgestone Invitational at Firestone Country Club South Course in Akron, Ohio, last July\n\nBut he might have had second thoughts when his twin 5-year-olds saw the camera and realized it wasn't a phone.\n\n'They were scratching their heads,' he recalled. 'They said, 'Daddy, why is it so big?''\n\nThe fact that so many wound up opting for the big camera likely had to do with the number of serious hobbyists. \n\nWhile many planned to share their photos with friends on social media, a few planned to commemorate the trip with a photo album — talk about old-school — and in the case of Wes Rackley, make quality 8x10 framed prints and give them as presents.\n\nFew people, though, seemed as comfortable carrying around all the serious gear as Brett Pavel of Atlanta. \n\nHe was at Augusta National for the 20th time — 'I think that's right,' he said, 'because I've got at least 18 shirts — and said he has a camera around his neck at least once a week.\n\n'My wife calls it my ""pacifier,""' he laughed, 'because our youngest son plays competitive soccer and she says taking pictures is the only thing that keeps me from cussing and yelling at the refs and everybody else.'", Fans on the Georgia course have adapted by going back to the future and using their pocket-sized digital or their old 35mm cameras.

And the pressure is on for agencies who can face a fines of up to $80,000 and six months in prison for employing too-thin models.\n\nBut former model Jennifer Sky, 38, from Brooklyn, New York, has revealed in an op-ed for the New York Observer that the fashion industry has already found a way around the regulations, explaining that thin models are now resorting to wearing weighted Spanx in order to cheat the new BMI standards. \n\nNew kind of pressure: Former model Jennifer Sky, pictured in 2013 (R) and 2003 (L), has reported that models are being asked to wear Spanx underwear stuffed with sandbags, so they can clock in at a 'healthy' weight \n\nDifferent rules: Models can be seen walking down the runway at the Masha Ma show in March at Paris Fashion Week. France recently passed a law banning models from the catwalk if their body mass index is too low\n\nAn anonymous model, referred to in the piece as 'Lauren', told Jennifer that she participated in Spanish Fashion Week, sometime after the country passed its new weight law in 2006 and recalled being asked to hide weights in her undergarments. \n\n'They gave us Spanx underwear to stuff with weighted sandbags so the thinnest of girls had a ""healthy"" weight on the scales,' Lauren said. 'I even saw them put weights in their hair.'\n\nJennifer went on to say that she hopes the US does not try to pass this 'discriminatory and misguided' because of its negative affect on naturally thin women. \n\nShe noted that when she was a teenager she too would have been deemed underweight because BMI calculations, which are based on weight and height, don't take age, sex or genetic body shape into account.  \n\n'At 16, when I was working as a fashion model, I weighed 115 pounds and was 5'7"" 1/2,' she wrote. 'I exercised regularly and really loved to eat Subway veggie sandwiches and drink McDonald's vanilla milkshakes.'\n\nMajor changes: Models can be seen strutting down the catwalk during the YDE show at Paris Fashion Week in March. Agencies who employ 'too-thin' models face large fines and even jail time under the new French law\n\nShe continued: 'I was not anorexic or starving - I was definitely over-worked. I was simply a naturally thin teenager with a powerful teenage metabolic system.'\n\nJennifer noted that as a teen with a BMI of 18.0, she would most certainly have been considered 'underweight'; while the exact BMI requirements for models working in France have not been released, the World Health Organization considers people with a BMI below 18.5 to be underweight and at risk of being malnourished.\n\nAnd while Jennifer says that, 22 years later her current measurements finally put her at a 'normal' 21.0, her BMI for most of her modeling career would have been deemed too dangerous for her to work under the new laws.\n\nWhile the model rights activist applauded the French government for attempting to protect the health of 'these young working professionals', she and Lauren both agreed that outlawing skinny altogether is not the answer.\n\n'I think a better solution is to raise the age limit for models to 18,' Lauren told Jennifer. 'Many ultra-thin models are simply still going through puberty, and allowing their bodies to form before their career would be beneficial to all.' \n\nModel rights activist: Jennifer spoke with Megan Alexander (R) about trafficking, abuse, and child labor problems within the fashion industry on Inside Edition in February \n\nStrict rules: The 38-year-old, who snapped this 'Post Fashion Week' selfie in February, noted her BMI would have been considered too low when she was a healthy 16-year-old model because she had a fast metabolism \n\nJennifer added that instead of putting restrictions on the size of young models, the French government should 'look to the modeling agencies who freely act as employment agencies without the responsibilities of treating their client-models as working professionals'.\n\nBecause models are considered independent contractors in the US, standard employment laws, which allow workers mandatory breaks, compensation for injuries and protection from sexual harassment, do not apply. \n\nSara Ziff, who is a model and founder of The Model Alliance organization, told Think Progress in March that she is also against the new French law because legislating body mass standards is not the same thing as the fashion industry promoting a 'healthy ideal'. \n\n'BMI suggests there are distinct categories of underweight, ideal, overweight and obese, with sharp boundaries that hinge on a decimal place, which is simply not true,' she explained. 'It is unfair and unreasonable to ban healthy models from working just because they have a relatively low BMI.'"," Former model Jennifer Sky, 38, claims that models are being asked to stuff their underwear with sandbags so they can clock in at a 'healthy' weight. The activist says she is against France's new law, which bars models from walking the runway if their body mass index is deemed too low.",['great'],1.0,1.0,1.0,0.9999999999999999,0.6976659211427579,0.748051848043002,0.0,0.5893825775084172,0.13633491187348434,0.0,0.7858997883191915,0.7554389949502334,0.7364980663820653,0.8333264968627763,0.24484157081458433,0.20490876160105112,0.884200937887066,0.3328350773761085,0.2896870208749248,0.8017346711528157,0.22828133170589915,0.1986119201725537,0.5806367843475291

But a snapshot of the tattoo is quickly helping the young father to gain national attention after it was shared on Imgur earlier this week.  \n\nAnd despite his critics' negative reactions to his tribute tattoo, Christien told Buzzfeed that he doesn't regret his decision to get the controversial ink, even claiming that he would happily get it done again.\n\nBold statement: Christien Sechrist (pictured) has a large tattoo of his son's portrait on his own face\n\nThe detailed portrait of the trainee electrician's son Perseus, which features his chubby cheeks and big eyes, takes up the entire left side of Christien's face, starting at the corner of his eyebrow and ending down by his chin. There is even some additional detail featured on his ear lobe.\n\nWhen he shared a picture of his new ink on his Facebook page last summer, Christien gave a shout out to the tattoo artist who designed the creation by thanking him for accurately rendering his son's image.\n\n'Thanks Cody Gibbs for doing awesome work on me. Looks just like my son,' he wrote.\n\nBut Christien soon found himself being berated by his friend Ashlee Nicole who asked if the picture was a joke.\n\nAfter Christien confirmed that it wasn't, Ashlee expressed her frustration with his choice of location for the tattoo, noting that the ink would likely make it difficult for the young father to get a job in the future.\n\n'Why on your f****** face?! How are you ever going to get a real f***** job to support your son with a tattoo on your face?' she asked. \n\nDoting dad: The 20-year-old, from Houston, Texas (thought to be pictured with his son Perseus), insists that he has no regrets about his distinctive facial ink, and claims that his young son 'loves it'\n\nSnap a selfie: Christien has eagerly defended his facial ink to his friends on Facebook, many of whom questioned why he chose to get the tattoo in such an obvious location\n\n'It's not funny!' Ashlee continued. 'I'm going to make you come live with [me] so you don't do stupid sh** like this. Although it is a nice tat, you should have put it somewhere else.'\n\nChristien went on to call it a 'beautiful tattoo of a beautiful face on top of another beautiful face'.\n\nMeanwhile, another friend, David Overbey, predicted that regret would eventually set in. \n\n'I give it [three] years before the regret starts [rolling] in,' he said, before noting: I'm not judging [though]. I think it's great work. But society frowns upon face tattoos.'\n\nChristien responded by saying: 'Well my son looked at it [and] smiled so that's all I care about.'\n\nMeanwhile, Derek Farmer argued that there are better ways to express his love for his son. \n\nArtistic expression: Christien already has a large tattoo design on the right of his face and the back of his head (pictured)\n\nFamily ties: The doting dad posts numerous pictures of himself and his family on his Facebook account\n\n'You don't need a portrait of your child on your face to convince your love for him,' he wrote.

Believe me, it isn't. But he put in the hard work and he rose to the top. There's a lesson there for a few of the blokes who pick up a mic today.\n\nI had the great honour of doing a stint on Channel 9 in Australia during an Ashes Test a few years ago. They'd only recently introduced the concept of using three commentators in one go and, as usual, Richie was keeping his contributions to a minimum. I mean that in a good way — again, another lesson for today's batch.\n\nAnyway, Richie had noticed something out in the middle and flicked what we call the lazy switch, so he could have a quiet word with the producer without the viewers hearing him. He wanted some footage of an incident he'd spotted a couple of overs earlier — Shane Warne had done something in the slips and it had passed the rest of us by.\n\nRichie Benaud was one of cricket's great personalities and will be remembered for his dry wit and knowledge \n\nBenaud was the voice of cricket for generations, commentating in his native Australia and for the BBC\n\nBenaud, pictured on his wedding day to wife Daphne, and during his later years in August 2005\n\nBenaud was a daring captain and became the first cricketer to score 2,000 runs and take 200 wickets in Tests\n\nFinally, the producer located what he wanted. Warne, who hadn't bowled yet — but who would go on to skittle England for the umpteenth time — had picked up his bowling marker, a small white disc, and thrown it to where he thought he'd be starting his run-up.\n\nBetween overs, they broadcast Warne's gesture. Richie said: 'Shane Warne's just put a marker down.'\n\nThat was his only contribution in the half-hour we were on together, but it beat anything else we had to offer. One line! It was classic Richie: he had the eagle eye to see what Warne was doing in the first place, the confidence to stay quiet while we rabbited on, and the perfect choice of words. As he might have put it himself: marvellous.\n\nI thought of Richie during the World Cup final last month. For some reason Star Sports, the tournament's global broadcasters, used a team of rookies to commentate on the match.\n\nSome of them were among the game's greatest modern-day players, but it was painfully apparent none of them had done much commentary. It was terrible TV. They just couldn't pinpoint the moment — no emotion, no elation, no despair. How we missed Richie that evening. He never went overboard but he could have captured all those qualities in that understated way of his. Sometimes he could be very understated indeed.\n\nDavid Gower, Geoffrey Boycott and Benaud assembled a formidable line-up for the BBC in 1995\n\nA master with the microphone to his lips, Benaud also was well aware of the power of silence\n\nAustralia cricket legend Benaud shakes hands with HM Queen Elizabeth II during his playing days\n\nI remember talking to Michael Slater, who teamed up with him in the commentary box in his later years. He spoke about one day when Richie did two half-hour stints as one of three commentators, and did not say a single word.\n\nSlats described it as 'bagging a pair', the term for a batsman who gets two ducks. But that was Richie. If there was nothing to add to the picture the viewers could see, he wouldn't add to it.\n\nIt really pains me now, for example, when commentators start reading out a graphic that has appeared on screen for all to see. It might be the top 10 leading runscorers at a particular ground, or something similar, and they just read out the list! It's incredibly lazy.\n\nRichie would consider the list, and then say something like: 'And No 4 could soon be moving to No 2.' He wouldn't even name names — he respected the intelligence of the viewer. And I know how much viewers responded to that.\n\nOne of his best qualities was that he never sought the limelight. He wasn't in it for the ego. He'd turn up in the commentary box and if he was off-air, he'd set up at the back of the box, take out his computer and do his homework on the newest player on the scene, or look up the latest horseracing odds.\n\nThe chemistry he had with the likes of Tony Greig and Bill Lawry was amazing. It was unmissable. And it was based on a deep mutual respect and love of the game.\n\nBenaud (front left) leads Australia off at Old Trafford in 1961 as England collapsed against his leg spin\n\nBenaud, pictured in 2006 during the launch of his book My Take on Cricket, was widely respected and loved\n\nBenaud pays tribute to Australian media mogul and cricket pioneer Kerry Packer after his death in 2005\n\nAnd, boy, he loved the game. One evening, Richie, Ron Atkinson and I were treated to dinner in Birmingham by the News of the World, who we were all working for at the time. Ron was covered in bling and telling us all how he could get into any nightclub in town and was ready for a lively evening.\n\nRichie wasn't a big drinker, but he'd allowed himself a couple of glasses of red, and he started telling this story about the great Australian leg-spinner Bill O'Reilly. It's fair to say the story was on the longish side and by the time Ron had disappeared into the night and Richie was being bundled into a waiting taxi, we were still learning all about Bill O'Reilly…\n\nHe had this wit that made all other commentators want to be like him. He didn't really go in for after-dinner speaking, but he might occasionally be asked to say a few words.\n\nOnce he spotted me in the audience, and quickly remembered the time I was hit in the groin by Jeff Thomson (have I mentioned that before?).\n\nTributes are seen at the statue of Benaud at the Sydney Cricket Ground after his passing aged 84\n\n'Ah, there's David Lloyd,' Richie said.

That same year, he had sex with a woman too inebriated to give her consent, prosecutors say.\n\nDespite admitting his guilt in December, D.C. prosecutors on Friday asked that Williams be spared prison time because he is himself the victim of a crime - the effects of which will mar the remainder of his life, Washington Post reports.\n\nNo jail time: Former Capitol Hill staffer Donny Ray Williams is disfigured from an acid attack that occurred years after he raped two women. A judge on Friday agreed with a prosecutor's recommendation that he not serve jail time due to his serious injuries, for which he's undergone 20 surgeries and still faces more life threatening operations \n\nThe decision to give Williams a suspended jail sentence and 5 years probation - which Judge Robert E. Morin reluctantly agreed to - came despite one of his victim's request he be given 'some jail time.' \n\n'He gave me a random dose of drugs and risked my life,' the woman argued in a letter read in D.C. Superior Court last week.\n\nThe woman had just moved to Washington as an intern. She initially warmed to Williams because she believed he could help her get a leg up on Capitol Hill.\n\n 'After the assault, I moved away, and he continued to harass me and threatened me to drop the charges. This crime has caused me fear, pain and a financial burden,' she wrote.\n\nThe other woman Williams raped was not present for the sentencing, during which Judge Morin said Williams 'was a victim of an independent crime and has serious medical issues.'\n\nWilliams' own attack occurred in 2013 as he walked down a Washington street.\n\nA man approached him and tossed acid in his face that dripped down his body, he told the Post.\n\n'I thought I was going to die,' Williams recalled.\n\nAcid attack: Williams was approached by a man in 2013 on a Washington street who tossed acid on his face. He believes a former girlfriend's jealous ex was behind the attack. He's now blind in one eye and nearly blind in the other\n\nMassive second and third-degree burns put him in the hospital for two months, blinded him in one eye and nearly blinded him in the other.\n\nWilliams believes the jealous boyfriend of a woman he was dating was behind the assault, the Post reports. \n\nMuch of his face is now gnarled and disfigured and he currently has a massive lump at the top of his skull where doctors have surgically implanted a rod that stretches his skin in order to promote healing.\n\nHe's undergone some 20 surgeries and still faces more 'life threatening surgeries.\n\n'How easy it is for men to use power to abuse,' Williams said in court. 'Rape is cowardly, shameful and downright evil. I promise, I will protect a woman's right to her own body.'\n\nHe'd previously denied the allegations against him, saying he only pleaded guilty because he wanted to focus on his health and not a trial.\n\nHe now says he's a $1 million in debt and jobless after spending years working with such notable politicians as Senator Mary Landrieu and Senator Herb Koh. \n\nHe worked in the Obama administration as the general deputy assistant secretary for congressional and intergovernmental relations in the Department of Housing and Urban Development between April 2009 and October 2010.\n\nWilliams had served as a staff director for the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs subcommittee. \n\nHe started working on Capitol Hill in 1999 for Rep.

This makes Mark Vanhoenacker's book, unwittingly, very timely indeed.\n\nWhen he was writing it he had never heard of Lubitz, of course, but nor does he dwell on the horrors of 9/11 or any other plane crashes either accidental or premeditated. Vanhoenacker is a senior first officer with British Airways, who wants us simply to understand his passion for his job, and to share with us many of its more beguiling secrets.\n\nLike me, he was still a child when he was first invited into an aeroplane cockpit, and like me, he regarded it as one of the transcendent treats of his young life.\n\nBut for him, the mystique endured. It is reassuring, now more than ever, to be reminded that even for experienced pilots air travel can still be an exhilarating, almost magical experience.\n\nMark Vanhoenacker is a senior first officer with British Airways and he wants the reader to simply understand his passion for his job\n\nVanhoenacker, an American, worked as a management consultant before rekindling that childhood obsession. He learned to fly in Britain, tempted by our 'historic relationship with aviation'.\n\nCoincidentally, his first job was to pilot the Airbus 320 on medium-distance European flights — exactly what Lubitz was doing on that catastrophically fateful day. But Vanhoenacker moved on to Boeing 747s, and they are his great love. He admires the 747 like a sculptor might a perfect human torso, observing how pleasing they are to the eye.\n\nVanhoenacker recalls a wildlife writer once describing Virginia's great blue heron as 'the 747 of the swamp' and notes how this would delight the aircraft's chief designer, Joseph Sutter, who was greatly influenced by the anatomy of birds. But Sutter (now in his mid-90s) once stated that the 747 is more 'a place' than a conveyance.\n\nPilots like flying 747s for all kinds of reasons, Vanhoenacker tells us, but not the least of them is one of the most prosaic: unlike the Airbus, in which pilots usually wear heavy socks, they have foot heaters. And the 'frozen surface of the Arctic Ocean looks better — everything looks better — when your feet are warm'.\n\nHe writes elegantly about his pilot's eye view of the world and explains that he has come to measure countries in jet time, ie how long they take to cross. Thus, Russia is a seven-hour country and Belgium, with a tailwind, is merely a 15-minute country.\n\nNoting the vast, desolate regions he routinely flies over, it does not surprise him that, according to one calculation, the portion of the Earth's surface on which an unclothed human could survive for 24 hours is just 15 per cent.\n\nBut of even more interest, certainly to those of us who occasionally fly long-haul, are the nuts and bolts of those journeys.\n\nVanhoenacker will get to the airport 90 minutes before he pilots his 747 to Los Angeles or Tokyo, and there will meet the rest of the crew, 20 or so strong. And 'meet' really means 'meet': air crews do not move as a pack, and are usually strangers to each other. As he puts it, 'our nametags are not worn only for passengers... There is a reasonable chance we may never speak to each other again in our lives.'\n\nBefore boarding, he will brief the cabin crew on what kind of flight time and weather to expect, while they will tell him if there's anything noteworthy about the passenger roster, and whether any of the BA staff on board have friends or family on the flight, people known, splendidly, as 'Klingons'.\n\nUnsurprisingly, life on a 747 is full of jargon: a second co-pilot on longer flights is known as 'the heavy', one acting as 'heavy out', the other as 'heavy home'.\n\nAnd for a pilot, the sky is full of aerial milestones called waypoints, with names usually comprising five capital letters.\n\nThese often relate directly to the place below, so above Boston in Vanhoenacker's home state, there is the waypoint LBSTA, referring to the region's prized shellfish, and another, NIMOY, after one of the city's more notable sons, the late actor Leonard Nimoy, who played Mr Spock in Star Trek.\n\nBut other names are harder to explain. Above St Louis, Missouri, are the waypoints ANNII and LENXX. Vanhoenacker's best guess is that an air-traffic controller there was a fan of Eurythmics' singer Annie Lennox.\n\nWho would have thought that the mysteries of flying would embrace Mr Spock, Klingons and Annie Lennox? Skyfaring is crammed with these revelations and more, while the acknowledgments end on a plaintive note.\n\nMaybe one day, Vanhoenacker hopes, wide-eyed children will again be allowed in the cockpit during a flight. In the meantime, he does a very good job of telling us what happens in there, and why we should still trust the men at the controls."," The Germanwings tragedy has ignited debate about depression in pilots.

It's called The Forgotten Man.\n\nOne of many critics of Blair's appearance on the election trail was George Galloway, who is fighting to retain Bradford West for the Respect party. He said: 'Blair dripping with blood, pockets stuffed with gold beyond dreams of avarice, comes out fighting for New Labour.'\n\nGalloway is one to talk.

'They now want to spend huge extra amounts of money on the NHS; Labour has ruled out almost all tax rises for most voters. The other parties want to spend more and don't want to talk about taxation.\n\n'The deficit? Apparently if it's left alone it's just going to melt away.

In his most recent gay rights decision for the court in\n\n2013, rejecting a legal definition of marriage limited to a man\n\nand woman for purposes of federal benefits, Kennedy deplored\n\nthat U.S. law for making gay marriages 'unequal.'\n\nScroll down for video \n\nA moment in history: People line up outside the Supreme Court in Washington April 26 ahead of Tuesday's arguments focusing on gay marriage\n\nThat 5-4 decision did not address a constitutional right to\n\nsame-sex marriage, but lower court judges interpreted the ruling\n\nas an endorsement of it and began invalidating state bans.\n\nWhen states appealed rulings striking down their same-sex\n\nmarriage prohibitions, the Supreme Court declined to intervene,\n\nmost notably in October 2014 when it denied appeals in seven\n\ncases on a single day.\n\nInstead, the nine justices are hearing in Tuesday's oral\n\narguments an appeal of the sole decision from a regional U.S.\n\nappeals court that went the opposite way. Last November, the\n\nCincinnati-based U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit\n\nupheld gay marriage bans in Ohio, Michigan, Kentucky and\n\nTennessee.\n\nWith 37 of the 50 states now permitting gay marriage, many\n\nbecause of judicial orders, it seems unlikely the country's\n\nhighest court would reverse course. Public opinion polls over\n\nthe last decade have shown large increases in support for gay\n\nmarriage. A ruling is due by the end of June. \n\nYet some questions remain.\n\nHow much will Kennedy, a member of the court's five-man\n\nconservative bloc who often casts decisive votes in close cases,\n\nshow his hand in the 2-1/2 hours of oral arguments? Will he\n\nreveal a clear view that the Constitution gives gay people a\n\nright to marry or will he voice concerns for state interests in\n\ncontrolling marriage laws?\n\nAn element of uncertainty hovers over Chief Justice John\n\nRoberts, who broke with the other court conservatives and cast\n\nthe deciding vote upholding President Barack Obama's healthcare\n\nlaw in 2012. Roberts voted against gay rights in the 2013\n\nruling. But he separated himself from the most conservative\n\ndissenters and declined to declare outright that states may ban\n\ngay marriage.\n\nHe has demonstrated apprehension about the reputation of the\n\ncourt that, by virtue of his service as chief justice,\n\ninformally bears his name. In his opinions, he has sometimes\n\ntried to lower tensions in controversial cases and reassure\n\npeople that the court is aligning with precedent and public\n\nexpectations.\n\nThe question is not only how Roberts might vote but what he\n\nmight write.\n\nIn the 2013 ruling, he denounced the court majority's\n\nsentiment that federal lawmakers were deliberately harming gay\n\npeople with the limited definition of marriage. 'I would not tar\n\nthe political branches with the brush of bigotry,' he wrote.\n\nFor the other seven justices, expectations are clearer.\n\nThe four liberals, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer,\n\nSonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan, have signaled their opposition\n\nto state same-sex marriage bans. On the other side have been the\n\nthree most conservative justices, Antonin Scalia, Clarence\n\nThomas and Samuel Alito, asserting that nothing in the\n\nConstitution guarantees same-sex marriage.\n\nTwo legal questions are before the justices: whether the\n\nConstitution's guarantees of due process and equal protection\n\ncover a right to same-sex marriage; and, if they do not, whether\n\nstates that ban same-sex marriages must recognize such unions\n\nperformed in other states.\n\nGay couples and their families, about 30 adults and 20\n\nchildren, have appealed the 6th Circuit's decision. The name\n\npetitioner is James Obergefell, who wanted his home state of\n\nOhio, which prohibits gay marriage, to recognize his Maryland\n\nmarriage to John Arthur as Arthur was dying from amyotrophic\n\nlateral sclerosis, also known as Lou Gehrig's disease.\n\nOfficials expect the courtroom to be packed to its 400-seat\n\ncapacity.

'That threatens to envelop everything at the moment. The story has become more of a distraction than him actually playing. It's become that big. The ECB and the England team's efforts to move on from him haven't worked so far but by winning that will allow them to move forward.'\n\nStrauss's views are as much from a cricketing point of view as a personal one, even though his feelings towards Pietersen clearly have not changed.\n\n'If you look at it from pure cricketing logic, after the Ashes is over, it's quite hard to see a situation where Kevin Pietersen would come back into the side,' Strauss told Wisden editor and Sportsmail cricket writer Lawrence Booth on the Lord's podcast. 'You're building towards the next Ashes in two and a half years time and the World Cup in 2019. \n\nPietersen has rejoined Surrey for the county season in an attempt to regain his England place \n\nPietersen's chances of a recall have been boosted by the likely appointment of Michael Vaughan in the new ECB director of cricket role created following the sacking of Paul Downton as managing director\n\n'I think if you were to bring Kevin Pietersen back it would be a short-term measure to help you win the Ashes but I can't see that happening personally because there are too many bridges to build in too short a period of time. I think after the Ashes the story does move forward at that point.'\n\nMichael Vaughan remains favourite to pip Strauss for a role that would have powers not enjoyed by anyone in English cricket since Ray Illingworth in the Nineties.\n\nGraves and new ECB chief executive Tom Harrison want to overhaul the system and make the new man more the equivalent of a football manager than a managing director, as was Downton.\n\nThat means the director of cricket will probably be a hands-on presence in the dressing room with overall responsibility for coaching and selection, with the panel of selectors almost certainly being disbanded.\n\nThere were key figures who wanted Strauss to take the job when Hugh Morris stood down 18 months ago, not least the Welshman himself, but at that stage Strauss felt it was too early for him and he has dabbled in commentary while not being a natural at it like Nasser Hussain and Atherton. \n\nPietersen and Vaughan pictured together on England duty at Lord's in 2008\n\nStrauss, who played in 82 Tests with Pietersen, believes his recall would only be a short-term measure\n\nNow the new regime at the ECB have moved the goalposts and the man Graves and Harrison want is clearly Vaughan, if they can persuade him to give up his extensive lucrative media work and other cricketing interests.\n\nVaughan is here to commentate on England's three-Test series against West Indies for Test Match Special and intriguingly is staying at the same hotel as the team.\n\nIt will be fascinating to see whether he changes a hard-hitting commentary style that has seen him criticise several of the players who he may well now take charge of, with the ECB looking to make a quick appointment.\n\nVaughan will need to build some bridges himself with a number of England players if he takes over but clearly Graves is not concerned by what has happened in the past and feels his fellow Yorkshireman is perfect for the role.\n\nJimmy Anderson, who will be playing his 100th Test needing four wickets to become England's leading wicket-taker, did not want to get drawn into which of his former England captains should get the big job. \n\nEngland bowler Jimmy Anderson refused to be drawn on who he would prefer to take up the role\n\n'I don't really have an opinion because we're concentrating on building up to a Test,' said Anderson. 'That's for the two new guys in charge. They've obviously got a clear plan of where they want to take English cricket and I'm sure they'll get the right man for the job.'\n\nEven though it was a diplomatic answer it was perhaps revealing that Anderson then named Hussain and Strauss as the best captains he has worked under, a view that was consistent with his autobiography where he offered little praise to the 2005 Ashes-winning captain Vaughan.\n\nClearly, Peter Moores and even Alastair Cook will be almost auditioning for Vaughan in this series and it is impossible to see Moores in particular carrying on as coach alongside a man in Vaughan who has been so critical of him.\n\nThe distractions that Strauss talked about, not just those provided by Pietersen, clearly still loom large over an England team who, it should be remembered, won the last three Tests they have played.\n\nIt is imperative, not least for their captain and coach, that they continue that run here."," Former skipper Strauss says Pietersen return is out of the question. KP would 'have too many bridges to build' before coming back . Batsman has joined Surrey to rediscover form ahead of Ashes. But Strauss says ongoing saga is too much of a 'distraction' Strauss has been linked to ECB director of cricket role .

Pictured are Nasa scientists completing a series of cryogenic tests on six James Webb Space Telescope beryllium mirror segments\n\nNasa describes the telescope as a 'powerful time machine with infrared vision that will peer back over 13.5 billion years to see the first stars and galaxies forming out of the darkness of the early universe.'\n\nThe project has drawn scrutiny from lawmakers for its ballooning costs - now at about $8.8 billion, far higher than the initial estimate of $3.5 bn (£2.33 bn).\n\nBut Nasa has promised to keep the next-generation telescope on track for its October 2018 launch.\n\n'What the Webb will really be doing is looking at the first galaxies of the universe,' Webb telescope observatory project scientist Mark Clampin.\n\n'We will also be able, with these capabilities, to look in very dark parts of the universe where stars are being born.'\n\nNasa describes the telescope as a 'powerful time machine with infrared vision that will peer back over 13.5 billion years to see the first stars and galaxies forming out of the darkness of the early universe'\n\nThe James Webb Space Telescope will be 100 times more potent than Hubble, and will be able to see back to 200 million years after the Big Bang.

'We are talking about little microbes.'\n\nThe announcement has been prompted by the recent discovery of water by Nasa in surprising places.\n\nJim Green, director of planetary science at Nasa, noted that a recent study of the Martian atmosphere found 50 per cent of the planet's northern hemisphere once had oceans a mile deep.\n\nA joint project of Nasa, the European and canadian space agencies, JWST will carry four instruments, including cameras and spectrometers that can capture extremely faint signals.\n\nInfra-red capability will help it observe distant celestial bodies, and its camera shutter will be able to remain open for long periods, explained Matt Greenhouse, JWST project scientist for the science instrument payload.\n\n'The Webb will have 70 times the light-gathering capacity of Hubble. So the combination of the large size and the infra-red capabilities will allow us to observe this epic of the universe past,' he said in an interview.\n\nEven more, the telescope should further the search for life elsewhere in the universe by opening a new window on planets outside the solar system  that might have water.\n\nAlready, Nasa's Kepler Space telescope, launched in 2009, has helped astronomers identify thousands of exoplanets. JWST is expected to propel that research even further.\n\n'Webb is quite big enough to have a high probability of finding bio signatures in the atmosphere of exoplanets, evidence of life,' Greenhouse said.\n\n'We have sensors on board, equipment on board that will enable us to study the atmosphere of exoplanets spectroscopically. So we will be able to understand the composition of those atmospheres,' he added.\n\n'We can make big progress in the search for life.'\n\nUnlike the Hubble Space Telescope, which circles the Earth, the JWST will go even further, to a place called L2, for LaGrange Point, 930,000 miles (1.5 million km) away in space.\n\nThat distance will keep the telescope cold, prevent it from being blinded by its own infra-red light and shelter it from radiation.\n\n'It will follow the Earth around the sun over the course of the year. So it's in a sun center orbit instead of an Earth center orbit,' said Greenhouse.\n\nThe heavy telescope is scheduled to launch atop an Ariane 5 rocket, made by the European Space Agency, from French Guiana in October 2018.\n\n'Just as Hubble rewrote all the textbooks, Webb will rewrite it again,' said Greenhouse.\n\nUnlike the Hubble Space Telescope, which circles the Earth, the JWST will go even further, to a place called L2, for LaGrange Point, 930,000 miles (1.5 million km) away in space\n\nThe distance will keep the telescope cold, prevent it from being blinded by its own infra-red light and shelter it from radiation\n\nThe heavy telescope, pictured here during testing, is scheduled to launch atop an Ariane 5 rocket, made by the European Space Agency, from French Guiana in October 2018", Nasa is on track to launch the James Webb telescope in three years.

Aiken told SiriusXM radio host Howard Stern, discussing his Esquire Network documetary program that chronicles his failed bid for a seat in the House of Representatives.\n\nThe show is called 'The Runner-Up,' a reference both to ths election and to his second-place finish in the second season of American Idol.\n\nAmerican Idol runner-up and congressional election runner-up Clay Aiken body-slammed Rep.

Crisco was a former state secretary of commerce and a political veteran.\n\nAiken is sketching out a second political life on the small screen, and lobbed some publicity for his show at Stern's gigantic audience – along with some slaps at Ellmers.\n\n'You should see the second episode, because she's a bitch,' he said during the interview.\n\nA spokeswoman for Ellmers scoffed at Aiken, telling Daily Mail Online that his 'crude language and disrespectful demeanor towards the congresswoman has proven to the American people why he is a runner up.'\n\nAiken doesn't much seem to care.

Got forward well as usual. \n\nManchester City right back Pablo Zabaleta keeps Enner Valencia at bay by putting in a crunching challenge \n\nMARTIN DEMICHELIS 6 – Careless slip let in Carlton Cole in the first half but otherwise looked relatively comfortable alongside a new defensive partner in Mangala. \n\nELIAQUIM MANGALA 7 - Dominant display from City's £32million defender who was able to enjoy a trouble-free return to the line-up, and snuffed out the few threats offered by the Hammers. \n\nALEKSANDAR KOLAROV 6.5 – Went close with slightly deflected freekick and another effort from a tight angle in the second half. Defensively, faced little threat from Valencia. \n\nFRANK LAMPARD 6 – Only his fifth Premier League start for City and of lack match sharpness showed on occasions as his touch let him down. \n\nManchester City midfielder Frank Lampard was given a rare chance to impress by starting against West Ham\n\nFERNANDO 6.5 – Didn't have too much on his plate but was alert to track Kouyate's burst from midfield in the first half and produced a fantastic interception tackle. \n\nJESUS NAVAS 8 – Much better from the little Spaniard. More direct and looked for an earlier pass, which contributed to both of City's first two goals. \n\nJesus Navas played a major role in Manchester City's two goals at the Etihad Stadium\n\nYAYA TOURE 7 – A more lively display than of late from the much-maligned Ivorian who passed the ball well and his interception started the move for City's second goal. \n\nDAVID SILVA 6.5 – Subdued display despite going close with a couple of efforts, and stretchered off following lengthy treatment after taking an elbow to the head from Kouyate. \n\nSERGIO AGUERO 7.5 – The Argentine's third goal in two games took his total to 26 for the season, and the top of the Premier League scoring charts with 20. Can't argue with that. \n\nSergio Aguero celebrates with City team-mates Navas and Yaya Toure after putting his side 2-0 up\n\nManchester City ace Sergio Aguero wheels away in celebration after scoring his 20th Premier League goal\n\nSubs: Caballero, Sagna, Boyata, Fernandinho (for Lampard 88), Nasri (for Silva 75, 6), Dzeko (for Aguero 90+1), Pozo.\n\nScorers: Collins og 18, Aguero 36\n\nBooked: Navas, Silva \n\nWEST HAM (4-1-4-1)\n\nADRIAN 6 – Had little chance with either of City's goals, particularly Collins's own-goal which looped over his head and in off the underside of the bar. \n\nCARL JENKINSON 6 – One of West Ham's better defenders and produced an excellent interception to deny Aguero an almost certain goal in the second half. \n\nJAMES COLLINS 5 – Won't enjoy seeing a replay of his freakish own-goal. Almost redeemed himself with a great block on Silva – but not quite. \n\nWest Ham centre back James Collins diverted the ball past Adrian to give Manchester City an early lead \n\nWINSTON REID 5.5 – Did his best to hold City at bay but guilty of an awful dive in the dying stages that was thankfully ignored by the referee and ridiculed by the City fans.\n\nAARON CRESSWELL 5.5 – After his goalscoring exploits against Stoke last weekend, had a difficult afternoon up against Navas and struggled to cope at times.\n\nALEX SONG 5 – Had his hands full trying to screen West ham's defence against the blue tide in the first half and replaced by Jarvis as Big Sam tried to salvage something in the second.\n\nAlex Song, pictured with Lampard, was replaced by manager Sam Allardyce in the 66th minute \n\nCHEIKHOU KOUYATE 6 – His arm into Silva's face was the talking point of a dull game. It seemed to be more careless than malicious but City may think otherwise.\n\nMARK NOBLE 5 – Overrun in midfield and was able to offer his team very little. Struggled tpo get into the game at all.\n\nSTEWART DOWNING 4.5 – Lost the ball in the build-up to City's second goal and that summed up his performance. Below-par and lacked any impact at all.\n\nENNER VALENCIA 6 – Anonymous in the first half but picked up a bit after the interval and had West Ham's best effort with a fine individual run and shot.\n\nCARLTON COLE 4.5 – Was gifted the Hammers' best opportunity in the first half but took too long to get a shot off. Struggled with little service and replaced by Nolan.\n\nCarlton Cole failed to impress on his first start  since his side's 0-0 draw with Southampton in February\n\nSubs: Nolan (for Cole 66, 6), Jarvis (for Song 66, 6), Nene, O'Brien, Amalfitano, Jaaskelainen, Burke.\n\nBooked: Kouyate, Downing\n\nReferee: Anthony Taylor 6.5\n\nStar man: Jesus Navas", Man City bounced back from derby defeat with 2-0 win over West Ham .

""The decision is connected with North Korean domestic affairs.""\n\nThe visit was highly anticipated because it would have marked Kim's first official foreign trip since inheriting the leadership of North Korea in late 2011.\n\nHe was to have met with Russian President Vladimir Putin as part of the May visit to coincide with Victory Day, marking the 70th anniversary of the Soviet Union's victory over Nazi Germany in World War II.\n\nKim also could have had the chance to rub elbows with the heads of about 30 other governments, including the leaders of China, Cuba, India, Germany, Vietnam and Venezuela. This number represents about half the world leaders that Russia has said it invited to the celebrations.\n\nKim's trip had been anticipated since late December, when Russian state media reported that Moscow had extended an invitation.\n\nThere was no further explanation, from Moscow or Pyongyang, as to why he wouldn't head west.\n\nStill, North Korea has a number of issues it's been wrestling with for years. They include widespread poverty, its longstanding spat with neighboring South Korea and the United States, as well as its international isolation largely due to its controversial nuclear program.\n\nAnd news about Kim's non-visit comes a day after South Korean intelligence agents told lawmakers that Kim is ruling with an iron fist, having ordered the execution of about 15 senior officials so far this year.\n\nCNN cannot independently confirm the executions detailed by Shin Kyung-min, a lawmaker with the New Politics Alliance for Democracy who attended the closed briefing.  And the nature of the intelligence supporting the allegations was not immediately clear.\n\nThat said, North Korea is one of the most closed societies in the world.\n\nAnd there's little doubt that Kim is very much in charge. According to Shin, intelligence officials say the North Korean leader is ruling in an impromptu manner and does not countenance excuses or any views that vary with his own.\n\nCNN's Madison Park and Alla Eshchenko contributed to this report.

Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon.\n\nThe seven-minute video, posted late Saturday, shows bearded militants using sledgehammers, jackhammers and saws to take down huge alabaster reliefs depicting Assyrian kings and deities. \n\nA bulldozer brings down walls, while militants fill barrels with explosives and later destroy three separate areas of the site in massive explosions.\n\n'God has honored us in the Islamic State to remove all of these idols and statutes worshipped instead of Allah in the past days,' one militant says in the video. \n\nAnother militant vows that 'whenever we seize a piece of land, we will remove signs of idolatry and spread monotheism.'  \n\nAttack: The video, made available by a Jihadist media outlet, shows ISIS militants destroying a stoneslab with a sledgehammer at what they say is the ancient Assyrian city of Nimrud in northern Iraq\n\nHorrified: The attack on the ancient site has been declared a 'war crime' by U.N.

During the reign of King Ashurnasirpal II, Nimrud served as the second capital for Assyrian Empire. Other Assyrian capitals were Ashur, Dur Sharrukin and Ninevah.\n\nNimrud and some of its kings were mentioned in the Bible, the city mentioned under the name of Calah or Kalhu in the Book of Genesis. \n\nExcavations at Nimrud were first started by the British traveler and archaeologist Austen Henry Layard from 1845 to 1851, followed by other foreign and local excavation missions.\n\nThe city is surrounded by a four-side wall measuring 8 kilometers (5 miles) long. Among the ruins are the grand palace of Ashurnasirpal II, as well as the temples of Nabu, the god of writing and the arts, and other temples.\n\nAmong the most significant discoveries at Nimrud were four tombs of royal women. There, a collection of 613 pieces of gold jewelry and precious stones were unearthed. \n\nThey survived the looting of the Iraqi National Museum that followed the U.S.-led invasion in 2003 as they were kept in a vault at the Central Bank of Iraq building by Saddam Hussein's government."," ISIS fighters destroyed ancient ruins of Iraqi Assyrian city of Nimrud dating back to the 13th century B.C. The attack, near Mosul, took place last month, but a seven-minute video of destruction has now emerged. It shows militants hacking and drilling away at 3,000-year-old relics and blowing up the ancient ruins. The U.N.

They were given 20 minutes to wolf down whatever their parents had packed for them and 20 minutes to play.\n\nIn 2009, Lisa and her husband made the move to France and she began working as a substitute teacher in Paris. \n\nWriting in her blog - Canadian Expat Mom - the 34-year-old said: 'I'll never forget dreading the fact that I was on lunchtime supervision because I saw that fish was on the menu that day.\n\n'I had been a teacher for long enough to know that there was going to be a lot of elementary school kids plugging their noses and telling me they didn't like fish. This was going to be a long supervision period.'\n\nBut those children proved her wrong - they didn't turn up their noses and even asked for seconds.\n\nScroll down for video \n\nSpeaking to MailOnline from her home in the Aquitaine region of southern France, she said: 'That's when I first encountered kids eating whatever was being put in front of them. \n\n'I was shocked because it wasn't necessarily what I wanted to eat.'\n\nFast forward five years to 2014, and Lisa had her own daughter to get ready for her first day at school. At three years old, she enjoyed a healthy continental diet but refused to eat vegetables.\n\nThree-course meal: Lisa Webb was nervous about sending her vegetable-phobic child to a school where pupils eat what they are served\n\n'Initially I think that we did give her everything, we eat very healthily as a family,' Lisa explained. \n\n'Even if we wanted to give our kids fast food it doesn't really exist. Fast food for us is grabbing a baguette and a chunk of cheese. \n\n'She ate everything but vegetables - foie gras, saucisson, lapin (rabbit). At home I stopped offering her broccoli because I didn't like wasting food.\n\n'I was a little bit nervous. I thought ""there is no way she can stay at school, she will be starving"".'\n\nWriting in her blog, she added: 'Each week I would head over to the bulletin board posted outside the school and check what they were eating for lunch. There wasn't a burger and fries or chicken finger to be seen on the list.\n\n'It all sounded so fancy. Was Julia Child working in the kitchen? How were they serving this to three-year-olds? Did they have a magic wand to get these kids to eat this very grown up list of food?\n\n'Whenever I would come across the ladies that worked in the lunchroom, I would stare in disbelief as they would tell me what a good eater my daughter was. \n\n'Were they sure they had the right kid? Because mine would barely touch a vegetable at home. Yet, she wasn't coming home hungry, so she must have been eating something.'\n\n'There's no plastic cutlery or non-breakable plates,' Lisa wrote. 'The kids are served their meal at the table, not buffet style'\n\nWhen the opportunity arose to spend a week in the canteen at lunchtime, where there is a constantly changing menu of salads, seasonal vegetables, meats and fish, the mum-of-two jumped at the chance.\n\n'There's no plastic cutlery or non-breakable plates,' she wrote. 'The kids are served their meal at the table, not buffet style. \n\n'This is France after all, where the gastronomic meal is protected as a UNESCO intangible world heritage item. There's no messing around when it comes to the French and eating.\n\n'All the kids ate what was served and there is no food brought from home. Each day at lunch there was a three-course meal; no exceptions. \n\n'The kids came into the lunchroom and sat politely using their manners, just like little adults. \n\n'They were always offered seconds when they were done, and not forced to eat something they didn't like, yet always encouraged to try it. Not liking something didn't happened often though.\n\n'However, if someone didn't like something there wasn't a fuss made, their plate was cleared and the next course was served.'\n\nWhen the opportunity arose to spend a week in the canteen at lunchtime the mum-of-two jumped at the chance\n\nThe meal at the French state school costs parents just €2.60 (£1.90) each day.\n\n'I think a big part of it is that they are with their friends and they see all the other kids eating the same thing,' she told MailOnline. 'There is no jealousy of what everyone else has. \n\n'I think it's amazing and it makes me happy that my kids are going to school here. \n\n'Since we have lived here we go out for dinner and see kids eating in restaurants. You don't see them with a kids' menu or colouring in front of them.\n\n'I think they learn it from when they are three years old. \n\n'My daughter eats a lot more and it was a good eye-opener for me to see what she will eat. She gets vegetables every night.' \n\nLisa, who is writing a book about life in France, added: 'My eyes have been opened and I am amazed by the what the French public school system does daily at noon.

Then she miscarried while taking birth control, she has said. \n\nMichelle then went off birth control and soon welcomed fraternal twins - and never used birth control again.\n\nNow Michelle and all her children proclaim that God does their family planning and they share their prolife beliefs on social media and the show.\n\nAnd lots of kids isn't all he shares with his parents. He and Anna also seems to be continuing a tradition with naming, as all 19 Duggar children have names that start with J, and his three children all have M names. \n\nJosh shared this photo of his pregnant wife and three children at the airport a few days ago. His eldest child is older than his youngest sister\n\nThe whole family is outspokenly pro-life, and josh and Anna are seen here kneeling when attending a rally earlier this year. Josh now works for the Family Research Council, a conservative prolife group\n\nJosh shared this photo of his wife and younger brother Joseph for Joseph's birthday - wearing anti Roe v Wade t-shirts for the occasion\n\nJill, the fourth eldest Duggar, welcomed son Israel David earlier this month, ten months after her wedding.\n\nAnd now the fertility streak is continuing with daughter Jessa and her husband Ben. \n\n'We are looking forward to being parents,' Ben told People on Tuesday.\n\n'I am feeling pretty good,' added Jessa. 'The morning sickness was different every day. It's getting better, but I'm still hanging on to the heartburn. And I don't have any super serious food cravings.'\n\nThe announcement does not come as too much of a surprise to fans as in late March an image of the two was uploaded to Facebook that suggested they could be expecting.\n\nBen was holding his wife's stomach in a pose typically struck by couples who are about to share the good news that they're planning for a little one.\n\nThe picture, in which the newlyweds are smiling and making the shape of a heart with their hands on Jessa's stomach, sparked rumors online of an impending pregnancy.\n\nAnna, left, got to be pregnant with Jill, right, for this her fourth pregnancy. The pair posed for this photo earlier this year, before Jessa's pregnancy was public \n\nFlashback! For her first pregnancy, Anna and her mother-in-law Michelle were pregnant at the same time\n\nMaking babies! They shared their passion online and the lovebirds in a romantic kiss after they married. They saved the first kiss for their wedding day and only held hands when they got engaged\n\nHiding her tummy: On Sunday the Duggar daughter shared this image to Instagram with the caption, 'Headed to Big Sandy, TX to meet up with my family!'\n\nThe two did not make any kind of statement at the time.\n\nIn her People interview, the TLC star explained that she found out she was with child when she took a pregnancy test one Sunday morning before church. \n\n'I said, ""Hey Ben, guess what? Yeah, you're a dad."" We couldn't believe it,' the daughter of Jim Bob, 49, and Michelle Duggar, 48.\n\nShe added, 'We are so excited. We have started talking baby names. It is one of those things that is so special, picking a name for a baby.' \n\nIt runs in the family: Jessa's older sister Jill Dillard, 23, and her husband, Derick, 26, welcomed son Israel David on April 6 after a 70-hour labor \n\nBen works for Jim Bob Duggar doing odd jobs, and Jessa was always chief organizer for her younger siblings, organizing their home school and packing for trips.\n\nNo doubt reality tv paychecks and assorted book and speaking fees will help the young couple afford the new addition. And both will have time to raise the little one.\n\nThe Seewalds live in a house on the Duggar property, owned by Jim Bob and Michelle. Previously Josh and Anna lived their, and welcomed their two older children into the world in home births in the house. Mackynzie was born int he master bedroom, and Michael was born while Anna was on the toilet.\n\nMarcus was born at a midwifery center.  \n\nIt's not known if Jessa plans to homebirth in the same house as Anna or not. \n\nJessa's older sister Jill Dillard, 23, and her husband, Derick, 26, welcomed son Israel David on April 6 after a 70-hour labor and an emergency c-section. They had planned a homebirth as well, as Jill is a midwife, but it didn't go as planned. Jill says the doctor stitched her up really well, however, and she hopes to have many more pregnancies and deliver future children vaginally.\n\nOn Tuesday evening during an episode of 19 Kids & Counting Jessa and Ben will feature a special message. Also in the episode a look at the couple's honeymoon in Venice and Paris is shared. \n\nThe two are seen kissing in Piazza San Marco as pigeons land on their heads. \n\nThe honeymoon! On Tuesday evening during an episode of 19 Kids & Counting, Jessa and Ben are seen visiting Venice, Italy where they kiss in Piazza San Marco as pigeons land on their heads\n\nYikes: The reality star was a put startled when a pigeon landed on her and said, 'When they see food they attack you'\n\nHe was impressed: While in the square Ben said, 'The city itself is tight and close together, but here is this big open square'\n\nJust like an old married couple: The TLC standouts talked about getting close with the birds; Jessa said she didn't like having their claws in her hair. THey also went to Paris on their honeymoon\n\nBeing pregnant has not changed Jessa and Ben's plans to adopt. \n\n'Our hearts haven't changed on adoption,' the star said.\n\nPeople noted the agency the couple has contacted 'requires prospective parents to be married for two years before adopting.'\n\n'We are still making plans,' she said.\n\nFor now the two are just soaking it all in. \n\n'We are trying to take it one day at a time,' Ben said.\n\nTheir wedding made for good ratings: The Arkansas residents tied the knot on November 1, 2014 in front of 1,000 people and the nuptials were aired on TLC\n\n'We pray every night that God helps us be good parents. We are getting advice from other parents.'\n\nAnd though Jessa is only 22, she has a good perspective on how things should move forward.\n\n'I am not comparing, not worrying about what could happen, we are just getting prepared,' the TLC favorite said.\n\n'I think having this first year together to share our lives, just the two of us, has been special. We are definitely excited to be parents.'\n\nTheir show 19 Kids & Counting airs Tuesdays (9 p.m. ET) on TLC."," Jessa, 22, and Ben 19, announced the baby is due on November 1, their wedding anniversary . The newlyweds said they are talking about baby names now but did not give any hints about the gender. This is a first child for the couple who star on TLC's 19 Kids & Counting .

But now - whether by luck or design - something seems to have clicked for Louis van Gaal and United are now playing with a cutting edge and with confidence. A Champions League return now looks likely.\n\nManchester United celebrated a 4-2 win over their closest rivals at Old Trafford on Sunday\n\nCRISIS FOR CITY AND PELLEGRINI\n\nCity's results since going joint top of the Barclays Premier League on New Year's Day make abysmal reading for a side of their quality. Their run of four league wins in 12 games - during a period in which they also went out of two cup competitions - surely constitutes a crisis for a club with their expectations. The already considerable scrutiny on manager Manuel Pellegrini will increase another notch.\n\nManuel Pellegrini is under increasing pressure after a woeful second half of the season for his team\n\nFELLAINI CONTINUES TO HIT BACK\n\nFor much of his first season at United, Marouane Fellaini looked out of touch and possibly out of his depth. That has all changed in the last few months as he has become increasingly important to Van Gaal. The midfielder uses his strength to great effect as United continue to loft the ball forward to him and teams find him difficult to dispossess.\n\nMarouane Fellaini celebrates after heading Manchester United into the lead in the first half\n\nFellaini has been key in United's recent run of form to lift them into third place in the Premier League\n\nCITY TEAM COMING TO END OF LINE\n\nThere can be little doubt that the City team, the core of which has won two Premier League titles, an FA Cup and a League Cup, is coming to the end of its lifespan. Reinvestment is clearly needed in the summer and, on this evidence, the back four would be a priority.\n\nYaya Toure looks on dejected during Manchester City's thrashing at Old Trafford on Sunday\n\nUNITED NEED TO IMPROVE DEFENSIVELY TOO\n\nFor all that United went on to dominate the game, City started superbly, reminding everyone of the quality they do still possess. They troubled United repeatedly at the back, where the central defensive partnership of Chris Smalling and Phil Jones again looked vulnerable. \n\nFormer Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson watches the game from the stands at Old Trafford\n\nFerguson was all smiles after Manchester United's victory, as was singer Mick Hucknall (left)", Manchester United beat Manchester City 4-2 at Old Trafford. Win moved United four points clear of their cross-town rivals. City went from joint top on New Year's Day to 12 points behind Chelsea.

'It's clear to see why they won 2-0.\n\n'The team were excellent but we didn't take our chances. Before tonight we had to win two games to stay in the division. We need six or seven points so my thoughts still haven't changed.'\n\nMillwall's best chance fell to substitute Paris Cowan-Hall in the 68th minute.

Anti-Semitism was deep in the 1930s and some Poles pointed Jews out to the Nazis, who often could not tell Jew from non-Jew. There were also some cases of Poles murdering Jews during the war.\n\nBut collaborating was never the official state position, as it was with Vichy France, for instance.\n\nIn fact, during the war, the Polish underground army had a program to save Jews, called Zegota. And Poles caught denouncing Jews to the Nazis were even killed by the Polish resistance.\n\nPresident Barack Obama caused a similar controversy in 2012 when he used the wording 'Polish death camp.' Poles feel that that wording implies Polish complicity, and Obama later expressed 'regret' for the gaffe.\n\n'In referring to 'a Polish death camp' rather than 'a Nazi death camp in German-occupied Poland,' I inadvertently used a phrase that has caused many Poles anguish over the years and that Poland has rightly campaigned to eliminate from public discourse around the world,' Obama wrote at the time.

Comey's comments are offensive to Poles as they had no role in running death camps and were themselves victims of the Third Reich.

The remarks came shortly before the 72nd anniversary of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising, which was commemorated on Sunday .

As well as the beautiful colours, they show the layout of individual scales, which give the insect its iridescence. This image shows the wing of a sunset moth\n\nThe photos were shot by Linden Gledhill from Staffordshire, who combines his love of photography with a PhD in biochemistry.\n\nThe 51-year-old uses a modified microscope and a camera to capture the detail of the butterfly's wing pattern. His photographs show the pretty insects' scale-covered wings.\n\nButterfly wings are covered by thousands of microscopic scales split into two to three layers, which gives them their Greek order name of Lepidoptera - meaning scaled wings.\n\nEach scale is pigmented with melanins that give butterflies black and brown colouring, but eye-catching blues, greens, reds and iridescence are created by the microstructure of the scales, rather than pigments themselves. \n\nSome of the scales look like exotic bird feathers, while others resemble autumnal leaves that change colour at the outer edges, such as this beautiful image of a detached scale from a tiger swallowtail\n\nThe tiny scales combine to give the striking colouration of the Eastern tiger swallowtail (stock image). It is a species of swallowtail butterfly native to eastern North America and is one of the most familiar butterflies in the eastern US, where it is common in many different habitats\n\nEach scale of a butterfly is pigmented with melanins that give butterflies black and brown colouring, but eye-catching blues, greens, reds and iridescence (pictured) are created by the microstructure of the scales, rather than pigments. A Papilio blumei fruhstorferi wing is shown\n\nThe brighter colours on some butterflies are created thanks to the scattering of light by the scales, such as these jagged examples, which are Papilio ulysees butterfly scales. In fact, each scale has multiple layers which are separated by air, so when light hits them it's reflected many times and the combination of these reflections causes us to see the intense yellows and blues of many butterfly species\n\nThe brighter colours are created thanks to the scattering of light by the scales, which are layered in different patterns on top of each other.\n\nIn fact, each scale has multiple layers which are separated by air, so when light hits them it's reflected many times and the combination of these reflections causes us to see the intense yellows and blues of many butterfly species.\n\nSome butterflies even reflect ultraviolet light, which is unable to be seen by humans. The ability of Monarch butterflies to detect ultraviolet light helps them on their annual migration from North America to Mexico, for example.\n\nMr Gledhill said: 'I've always taken macro photographs of insects, moths and butterflies. I have a lifelong interest in exploring the world beyond what the unaided human eye can see.\n\n'This led me to use research quality microscopes and combining the two skills.'\n\nHe uses a trinocular-reflecting light microscope fitted with Neo S-plan objectives, or attachments, and takes the photographs using a Canon EOS 5D mark II, which is fitted to the top of the microscope.\n\nThe microscope has also been modified by adding a StackShot stepping motor and controller to drive the focusing control, meaning very small steps can be made in the focusing stage.\n\nMr Gledhill said: 'I've always taken macro photographs of insects, moths and butterflies.

This close-up image shows scales on the wings of the monarch butterfly\n\nMr Gledhill imaged the Madagascan sunset moth's wings in minute detail.

This camera is fitted to the top of the microscope. Overlapping pale blue scales are pictured\n\nThe depth of field in a single microscope image is too small to see the whole of the butterfly in one image, so Mr Gledhill takes up to 200 separate images spaced by one micron intervals to capture the creatures.\n\nThese images are then combined into a single imaging using focus stacking software, resulting in pictures that are sharp and in full focus.\n\n'The pictures are stunningly beautiful and they make me realise how lucky I am to be able to capture the intricate structure of butterflies,' Mr Gledhill continued.\n\n'Often people think they are fabric and appear very surprised when they find out they are the scales which look like dust which they remember experiencing when they touched a butterfly as a child.' \n\nThe depth of field in a single microscope image is too small to see the whole of the butterfly in one image, so Mr Gledhill takes up to 200 separate images spaced by one micron intervals to capture the creatures, before carefully combining the shots.

He used a trinocular-reflecting light microscope with a Canon EOS 5D mark II camera is fitted to the top. Images include close-up shots of the peacock swallowtail, a sunset moth and the mother of pearl butterfly.","['This begins with a reference to ""the stunning photographs"" without introducing them, which makes it a bit awkward. It has an inaccuracy (""peacock swallowtail""), and it does not mention the scales on the wings, which I consider a key piece of information from the post. \\n\\nIdeally, this would go into less detail on the setup for taking pictures and include a bit more info on the wings themselves.

He voluntarily spoke with authorities and is cooperating with their investigation\n\nWeinstein, who has produced several Oscar-winning films, such as Shakespeare in Love, Pulp Fiction and The King's Speech, is said to have met Battilana on Thursday last week at the opening of a show at Radio City Music Hall.\n\nThe next day he invited her for a business meeting at his Tribeca Film Festival office on Friday night.\n\nShe claimed the 63-year-old Hollywood producer asked her if her breasts were real before touching them and putting his hand up her skirt. He also asked her for a kiss, she claimed.\n\nSecurity footage shows the model speaking on the phone as she exited the building half an hour after arriving, it has been reported.\n\nMr Weinstein has spoken to police and denied the accusations, but a recorded conversation between him and Battilana shows he did not deny the incident, it has been claimed.\n\n'He didn't deny doing what she said he did to her,' the source told the New York Daily News. 'The content of the phone call, there's no question about what he did.' \n\nShe also convinced him to meet him a restaurant and the NYPD were also there to watch that meeting, according to the newspaper.\n\nIt is not clear if he was aware he was being monitored, but following the call and the meeting, he voluntarily went to speak with police on Saturday.\n\nHe requested a lawyer and has promised full cooperation with the probe.\n\nWeinstein could face misdemeanor charges of forcible touching or sexual abuse if the allegations are credible. No charges have been filed and his representatives say they believe he will be cleared.\n\n'We are confident that we will be fully vindicated,' a Weinstein spokesman said.\n\nA source close to The Weinstein Company told Page Six the groping allegations were nothing more than a 'blackmail attempt' and insisted the award-winning producer 'did nothing wrong'.\n\nModel: Battilana (pictured) claims he assaulted her at his office on Friday after meeting him at a red carpet event on Thursday night.

It is made by taking a small amount of blood from a patient's arm (amounts vary depending on wound size, but typically no more than a couple of tablespoons) and then processing it in a machine that spins the blood at high speed until it separates into its various components.\n\nBlood is largely made up of a clear yellowish liquid, called plasma, but it also contains small, solid compounds - red cells, white cells and platelets. The platelets are important for clotting, but they also contain hundreds of proteins called growth factors that are important for healing.\n\nU.S. researchers are testing the new gel it as a dressing for burns \n\nSpinning the blood leaves behind the plasma and the platelets but in higher concentration - up to ten times greater than usual.\n\nPlatelet-rich plasma is sometimes used to treat tendon injuries and is also used in some cosmetic procedures that claim injecting it into the face can rejuvenate skin - nicknamed the 'vampire facelift'.\n\nU.S. researchers are testing it as a dressing for burns. As well as boosting healing, it is thought the gel, known as Magellan Bio-Bandage, will act as a barrier against infection.\n\nThe researchers also hope using platelet-rich plasma will address a common problem with burns, which is that they often continue to get worse hours or even days after the original injury.\n\nThis can mean a burn that had initially caused damage to the outer layer of skin (the epidermis) and the underlying tissue containing the hair follicles and sweat glands and smaller blood vessels (dermis) can become a 'full-thickness' burn.\n\nPlatelet-rich plasma is sometimes used to treat tendon injuries and for cosmetic procedures\n\nThis is where there is damage to the third and final layer of skin - the subcutis, which contains larger blood vessels and nerves, and regulates the temperature of the skin and body. Full-thickness burns usually require extensive treatment, including skin grafts.\n\nIt's hoped the platelet-rich plasma will allow the wound to start to heal before it can deteriorate.\n\nThe U.S. trial uses a new blood-spinning machine that is designed to be used at a patient's bedside, collecting it in a syringe ready for immediate use as a gel. Previous research suggests that the high concentration of growth factors in the platelet-rich plasma helps stimulate growth of new blood vessels and skin tissue. It's also suggested that it reduces pain, though it's not clear why.\n\nFor the latest study, at the University of Utah and other burns centres, about 40 patients will have up to 18ml of the platelet-rich plasma (about three teaspoons) applied on to a partial-thickness burn within 72 hours of the initial injury. The quantities used may vary depending on the size of the injury.\n\nCommenting on the treatment, Dr Bav Shergill, consultant dermatologist at Queen Victoria Hospital, East Grinstead, said: 'This is emerging technology that is causing a great deal of excitement. Platelet-rich plasma is already being used by orthopaedic surgeons with some amazing successes.\n\n'We are all looking for a method to collect and purify a high concentration of these effective molecules to improve repair in skin disorders. I look forward to large-scale trials of PRP showing similar results.'\n\nMeanwhile, a combination of platelet-rich plasma and stem cells is being tested as a treatment for knee arthritis. Researchers at the Post Graduate Institute of Medicine in Chandigarh, India, believe injections of both substances will help regenerate worn-out cartilage, the tissues that cushions the joint.\n\nStem cells have the ability to turn into different cell types. About 40 patients will be given injections of either stem cells and platelet-rich plasma or just platelet-rich plasma and the results compared.", Gel contains platelet-rich plasma (PRP) The concentrated mix of substances in the blood play a role in healing.

And those paintings, and my collection of Scalextric cars. Honest'. \n\nHammond added: 'As a serious collector of motorcycles, it's important to review one's stable regularly, and the Bonhams Stafford sale is the ideal opportunity to move bikes on and possibly acquire new ones.\n\nHammond and May also revealed they are selling off a dozen bikes from the classic motor cycle collections\n\nThe BBC confirmed they will fulfil the Top  Gear live gigs, but they will be stripped of the Corporation's branding\n\n'I also have a canoe, and some Wharfedale hi-fi speakers, if anyone's interested'. \n\nHowever the BBC has confirmed that Top Gear's live world tour will go ahead next month, with the three original presenters at the helm.\n\nThey will do a series of gigs, which have already sold 200,000 tickets worldwide and made £10million, but the show will be stripped entirely of all BBC branding.\n\nClarkson was sacked from Top Gear on March 25 after it was found that he had punched producer Oisin Tymon in a 30-second assault, leaving him with a split lip and needing hospital treatment.\n\nThe BBC announced 'a line has been crossed' and 'there cannot be one rule for one and one rule for another' following the suspension. \n\nJeremy Clarkson was sacked by the BBC after he punched Top Gear producer Oisin Tymon (pictured)", Top Gear's website previously featured all three presenters at top of page.

'Diane, the director of Neverland, always calls me JM Gary and says she is going to get me up on stage.\n\n'I cannot act whatsoever, so I think I'm just going to stick to writing and singing.'\n\n'He completely trusted our music': Gary revealed Hollywood mogul and Finding Neverland producer Harvey Weinstein has been extremely encouraging since bringing him on to write the music for the Broadway musical\n\nBig night: On Wednesday Gary's Finding Neverland had its Broadway premiere \n\nThat's what friends are for: It was the new Late Late Show host James Corden who first put Gary in touch with Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein when he was looking for someone to write the score for his musical\n\nMeanwhile, Gary admitted he is dismayed by Louis Walsh's recent declaration that his X Factor days could be numbered and said he hopes the veteran judge doesn't leave.\n\nBarlow exclusively told MailOnline: 'I really hope he doesn't leave. To me he's the life of that show. He brings the silliness to it and that's what everyone loves. He's a big part of it behind the scenes too. I don't think they should lose him.\n\nI think what could happen is he might leave and then they'll get to auditions and send a plane for him.'\n\nStronger than ever: Gary believes that Zayn Malik's (second left) departure from One Direction won't stop the band going on to even greater success\n\nJust as Jason Orange's departure from Take That shocked fans, so too did Zayn Malik's recent decision to quit One Direction.\n\nBut Gary believes the remaining members Niall Horan, Harry Styles, Liam Payne and Louis Tomlinson will come out it stronger than ever.\n\nGary, who also saw Robbie Williams leave Take That in 1995, said: 'I think it's slightly easier for the band. You can lean on each other. I think it's always harder for the one who leaves.\n\n'For One Direction it's just a transitional period.

When the time comes, young girls say goodbye to their loved ones and part ways, filing up concrete steps leading up to the floor above.\n\nThere, inside a large room dotted with brown tables, rows of flashing computer screens await for them.\n\n""When the parents are praying [downstairs], we are teaching the girls upstairs,"" explains tech entrepreneur Regina Agyare, who comes here every week to teach local teens how to code.\n\nAgyare's first visit to see the girls -- students at education project Achievers Ghana -- was in January 2014. This was supposed to be a one-off seminar as part of her mentorship initiative ""Tech Needs Girls"" -- however, the students proved quite a draw.\n\n""I fell in love with them, so I decided to set up a coding club and started having regular sessions,"" says Agyare, founder of software development company Soronko Solutions.\n\nMore importantly, continues Agyare, it offered the opportunity to show ""the community the value of educating girls.""\n\nA predominantly Muslim area in a largely Christian nation, Nima has one of the densest populations in Accra. Agyare says life is often challenging for many  local girls, with some growing up without ever leaving the community.\n\n""Girls were being forced to marry early; [denied] their right to go to school. Most of their dreams and aspirations were limited to just what was around them.\n\n""I was shocked... I thought we had progressed as a nation. I thought we had gone past that.""\n\nThis, in part, was why Agyare lent her support to Achievers Ghana.\n\nSet up by local Amadu Mohammad, the non-profit organization supports 250 girls between the age of six and 18, priming them for formal education through extracurricular classes in reading, math, poetry and information technology. Its goal is to break through social barriers and provide Nima with a generation of female role models, and so the group provides school funding to help the girls shape their own future.\n\nThe project was bequeathed its classroom above the mosque it shares a building with, and Agyare says the two work closely together. Achievers Ghana met initial resistance from local conservatives, but when the mosque's chief imam Sheik Hussein Abdul Rahman championed Mohammad's vision, few maintained their reservations.\n\nNow, with parents paying a nominal fee towards the running of the organization, it is in everyone's interest that the girls succeed.\n\nFourteen months after her first visit, Agyare's coding class is well established. She has set up a mentor scheme as part of ""Tech Needs Girls,"" recruiting and training women at university to act as role models for her younger students in Nima.\n\nIn each class, around 50 girls are taught HTML and run a blog called ""Slum Voices"".\n\n""I definitely feel [technology] has given them more of a voice,"" Agyare says. ""I feel like it's allowed them to express themselves and interact with others... for them, it's important to be heard.""\n\nSome girls had never used a computer before the classes began, but Agyare's even-handed approach has brought all her students up to the same standard. Agyare insists that ""we don't leave anyone behind.""\n\nTo that end, a few young male faces have found their way into her classroom.\n\nThis was an accidental revelation, according to Agyare. She details the story of one affronted boy.\n\n""He wrote that he didn't like it when he saw girls learning about computers... it was difficult [for him] to see girls being empowered; he wasn't used to that.""\n\nAgyare realized that by integrating genders in her classroom she could begin to confront gender expectations.\n\nFor many boys the role of a girl is ""to be their wife,"" Agyare explains, ""and she needs to be taken care of."" However, by running mixed classes boys from an early age ""can learn to see a woman as a contributing person [within society].""\n\nNow the hope is that many of the young students will be able to go to university -- and Achievers Ghana is working on a scholarship program to make the prospect attainable.\n\nAgyare says the goal is not to turn every girl into software developers but to enable them to ""use technology in whatever field they find themselves.""\n\nShe adds: ""It would be great if we had some girls that decided to go on and study computer science, but really it's about helping them reach their full potential ... and bring change to the community.""\n\nRead this: 5 reasons why tech needs geek girls\n\nMore from African Start-Up"," Many girls in Nima,one of Accra's poorest slums, receive little or no education. Achievers Ghana is a school funded by the community to give the next generation a better chance of success.

You think it's going to be easy because we have said 'We are going to have good relations with you' and they say, 'That's not exciting for us and it is for you.' So they are hard negotiators as they always have been.""\n\nThe forum could provide the opportunity to push forward an agreement to re-establish formal relations and re-open embassies after nearly four months of negotiations.\n\nWhile President Barack Obama is not scheduled to meet Cuban leader Raul Castro, U.S. officials said there will be opportunities for ""interaction"" between the two leaders.\n\nThe first time the two heads of state met was in 2013 at Nelson Mandela's funeral. Their brief handshake captured the world's attention and lit up social media. Few people then knew that the two countries were secretly involved in negotiations to thaw five decades of deadlocked Cold War-era relations.\n\nObama had said he had hoped a U.S. Embassy would reopen in Havana before the summit, but Cuban officials have said they cannot imagine a full restoration of diplomatic ties until Cuba is removed from the U.S. State Department list of countries that support terrorism.\n\n""It would be difficult to explain that diplomatic relations have been resumed while Cuba has been unjustly listed as a state sponsor of international terrorism,"" said Josefina Vidal, the general director of U.S. affairs at the Cuban Foreign Ministry and lead negotiator in the talks.\n\nCuba was added to the list in 1982, which includes Syria, Iran and Sudan. The designation carries financial sanctions which Cuban officials say further damages their already ailing economy.\n\nThe State Department has sent a recommendation to the White House that Cuba be removed, paving the way for the White House to announce its intent to de-list Cuba as early as this week, two administration officials told CNN.\n\nRemoval from the list ""does not relate to whether or not we agree with everything a country does or whether we agree with its political system, or its foreign policy,"" Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes said on a conference call with reporters Tuesday. ""It's a very practical review as to whether or not a government is sponsoring terrorism.""\n\nRhodes also dialed backed rhetoric on Venezuela, saying the country did not pose a national security threat to the United States, despite a recent declaration to that effect.\n\nThe designation was meant to allow officials to target seven allegedly corrupt Venezuelan officials, but it ignited a firestorm, particularly in Cuba, which has close ties to Venezuela.\n\nDeceased Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez was a friend and admirer of former Cuban leader Fidel Castro. Chavez's successor Nicolas Maduro continues to send Cuba tens of thousands of barrels of oil each day, despite his country's own economic turmoil.\n\nIn exchange, Cuba sends doctors, military advisers and sports trainers to Venezuela.\n\nIn Cuba's state-run media, criticism of U.S. policy towards Venezuela has overshadowed the improvement in U.S.-Cuba relations.\n\nIn March, Fidel Castro published a letter criticizing the U.S.' ""brutal plans towards"" Venezuela and the Cuban government promised ""unconditional aid"" to help defend against American threats.\n\nIts remains to be seen how much Cuba will risk its warming relations with the United States to back up ally Venezuela.\n\nBut apparently there is little doubt among the Cuban people on what their government should do.\n\nA poll of 1,200 Cubans released on Wednesday found that 97% of the people surveyed by Miami-based polling firm Bendixen & Amandi on behalf of The Washington Post and Univision Noticias/Fusion supported improved U.S.-Cuban relations."," Cuba pulled off a diplomatic coup by gaining attendance at Summit of the Americas.

A coroner has called for the 'dangerous' cot to be pulled from the shelves after the newborn baby girl was strangled\n\nGrace's mother Esther put her down for a nap at around 8.30am on April 9. The cot – which is designed to be placed next to a parent's bed – has a moveable panel on one side which can be folded down, leaving a ridge just 7cm high.\n\nMrs Roseman returned about 90 minutes later to find Grace unresponsive, lying with her head over the edge of the cot.\n\nThe provisional cause of death was given as asphyxia, caused by the ridge cutting off the oxygen supply from Grace's windpipe.\n\nIn her report, Mrs Schofield listed a number of concerns surrounding the cot. She said: 'In my opinion urgent action should be taken to prevent future deaths ... should another baby be placed in the prone position and left with the side incompletely lowered again in one of these cots, another death could occur. \n\n'If the cot's side is not safe to be incompletely lowered or for the cot to be tilted more than 5cms then it should be questioned as to whether these should be options available at all.'\n\nGrace's father Gideon, who lives with his wife in Haywards Heath, West Sussex, said: 'There are no words that can describe how we feel about the loss of our beautiful little Gracie. \n\nGrace's parents told the inquest 'We are eternally grateful to the doctors and nurses at the Princess Royal Hospital in Haywards Heath (pictured), who did everything possible to try and save our little Gracie'\n\n'She was just starting to develop her own little personality and was always smiling. We would not wish any parent to have to go through such a devastating loss.' \n\nThe National Children's Trust has pulled the cot from sale and stopped all pending orders going out. Susie Parsons, interim chief executive of the charity, said: 'This is a tragedy and our thoughts and deepest sympathies are with the Roseman family at this time.\n\n'We have immediately suspended all sales and despatches of the Bednest crib until the completion of the inquiry and we will also undertake our own detailed and thorough review.'\n\nBednest, which is based in Stratford-upon-Avon, is still selling the cribs on their website from £249. The page boasts an endorsement from Jools Oliver, the wife of celebrity chef Jamie. Mrs Oliver writes: 'We love the Bednest ... I love the way it is so close to our bed the sides are really easy to pull down.\n\n'Easy and definitely eliminates the fear of falling asleep with them in your bed and suffocating them as they lay safe next to you but in their own safe little cosy bed.'\n\nA spokesman for Bednest told MailOnline: 'We are greatly saddened and extend our heartfelt condolences to Grace's parents.\n\n'We are doubly upset to hear this news, since the concept behind Bednest's design is first and foremost about baby health and safety and came originally from highly experienced neo-natal nurses.\n\n'It is not the case that the coroner has called the cot ""dangerous"" and asked for it to be withdrawn.\n\n'The coroner has highlighted that all safety guidelines for the correct use of the crib are laid out in the instruction manual, but due to a growing second-hand market for our Bednest cribs, these instruction manuals may not be passed on. This may be, sadly, what happened with Grace's crib.\n\n'We are now considering displaying basic instructions on the side of the crib itself.'"," Seven-week-old Grace Roseman died in adjustable Bednest Bed Side crib.

On Saturday, at the 161st Oxford-Cambridge Boat Race, the women's crews will battle the same Thames course as the men, who will follow an hour later.\n\nAfter decades of campaigning and 88 years since the first women to race were jeered by male spectators, they get equal billing. And for Wilson's grandfather, 85-year-old Richard Cowell, from East Kilbride, it will be a momentous day. He is not up to the journey to watch his granddaughter compete for Cambridge but will still see the race, which will be televised for the first time.\n\nWilson, 21, said: 'I remember when I was 14 watching with my dad and my brother and saying ""Are there going to be women on?"" They laughed — not in a malicious way — and said: ""There aren't any women, you could cox I guess"". So the fact that 10 years on there is a women's race on the Tideway and I'm in it is pretty remarkable. It's so wonderful that my grandfather will be able to watch it, too.'\n\nMelissa Wilson (left) and Caroline Reid of Cambridge Women's boat crew at Thames Rowing Club in London\n\nClare Balding gave up her regular stint on Channel 4's Grand National coverage to present the event because she wants to send a message about the importance of women's sport. 'It was a big decision to make,' said Balding. 'But there will never be another first women's Boat Race on the Tideway.'\n\nHer statement was welcomed by Caroline Reid, the Cambridge president. 'It brings the attention of another audience, people who follow Clare,' said Reid, 24. 'Maybe people who support the Grand National disagree but they will at least be aware it's happening and that is a good thing.'\n\nWilson, a third year English literature student and Reid, in her fifth year of veterinary medicine, rise at 5.30am each day for training, gym work and lectures, then it's back out on the river in the afternoon.\n\nCambridge Women's Boat Crew including Wilson (front) rowing the Thames\n\nReid, Claire Watkins and Wilson prepare ahead of the Boat Race next Saturday\n\nUntil this year, the women's race was held a week before the men's at Henley. The course was 1.2 miles compared with this year's 4.22 mile battle from Putney to Mortlake.\n\n'At Henley it's straight, so conditions are largely the same the whole way down,' said Reid. 'Tideway conditions change because the river bends. There's a different mental and tactical side, which is exciting.'\n\nBut Reid refuses to be seen as a pioneer. 'The first women's race was in 1927 and there were a lot of people against it, talking about whether women should be rowing at all and what they should be wearing, so they were the pioneers. We're just carrying on in their footsteps,' she said.", After decades of campaign the women's crews are to make history.

She also urged her fans to remind their parents to get checked.\n\nFamily: Wilson is pictured with Hanks and one of their sons, Chester, in December 2011. The couple has two sons together and Hanks is also father to a daughter and son from his first marriage\n\nInvasive lobular carcinoma is a type of breast cancer that starts in the milk-producing glands of the breast and spreads in a web-like manner.\n\nDue to this, it does not typically form a lump, as is expected with breast cancer, and instead causes a thickening of the tissue, making one part of the breast feel fuller than other areas.\n\nOther symptoms including a change in the texture of appearance of the skin on the breast, such as dimpling, or an inverted nipple.\n\nWomen with this type of breast cancer are usually a few years older than women diagnosed with other types, and it is more likely to occur in both breasts compared with other types.\n\nThe cancer is invasive, which means it has the potential to spread to other parts of the body.\n\nIt can be found through screening tests including physical exams or mammograms. Mammograms are encouraged yearly when a woman turns 40s or earlier if they have a family history of breast cancer.\n\nTreatment includes removing part or all of the breast followed by chemotherapy or radiation.\n\nAccording to the American Cancer Society, more than 180,000 women in the U.S. are diagnosed with invasive breast cancer each year, and about one in ten cases are invasive lobular carcinomas.\n\nThe earlier the diagnosis, the better the prognosis. Patients have a slightly better outlook for both short- and long-term survival compared to other types of breast cancer.\n\nAccording to a study by Breast Cancer Research, the five-year survival rate is 85 per cent.", Stars such as Katie Couric and Christina Applegate praised the 58-year-old actress for revealing her diagnosis in a statement on Tuesday. She explained that doctors initially failed to find the cancer but that it was discovered after she sought out a second opinion.

'Then all of a sudden I saw this car just swerve violently across to the left.\n\n'It completely disappeared and I remember looking into the hard shoulder. Then I saw what looked like a little explosion.\n\n'Bits of tree and bits of plastic came out in front of me. When I saw the dogs, I started to put together what had happened.'\n\nChild protection worker Gary Donald, who was driving a Kia Picanto on the southbound carriageway, also gave evidence to the court about the crash on March 21 last year.\n\nHe told jurors he saw the pick-up veer sharply from right to left - performing 'almost a straight turn' - and move towards a line of trees.\n\nThe couple, who were said to have had a 'troubled' relationship, had married in Cyprus in 2012 but their relationship is alleged to have become abusive soon afterwards, jurors heard \n\n'The canopy of all the trees shook - I would use the word 'imploded' - and there was luggage, bits of car, and parts of tree flying into the air,' Mr Donald said.\n\nUnder questioning from defence QC Christopher Millington, Mr Donald agreed that time-lapse CCTV footage of the L200 showed a 'rather less dramatic' veer than he had described to the court.\n\nWitness Steven Prince, a passenger in a Range Rover which stopped at the scene, told how he attempted to reassure Mrs Walters before she was cut free.\n\nGiving his recollection on the aftermath of the crash, Mr Prince told the jury panel he did not witness the moment of impact but had seen a cloud of dust.\n\n'I looked left and I saw two dogs out where they shouldn't be and I saw the car that was already in the tree.'\n\nAfter the crash, the metalwork of the vehicle had to be 'unpeeled' from around Mrs Walters by emergency crews, the court was told \n\nThe Mitsubishi L200 veered onto an embankment near junction 22 of the southbound carriageway in March last year. Pictured: Emergency services at the scene of the crash\n\nProsecutors allege that Walters, a driving test examiner, deliberately steered his Mitsubishi L200 off the motorway after his wife said she wanted a divorce and made allegations of domestic abuse\n\nAfter getting out of his mother's car, Mr Prince said, he ran along the hard shoulder towards the crashed vehicle.\n\n'The car was a hell of a mess,' Mr Prince added. 'I didn't bother looking at the driver's side because I thought whoever was in there was going to be squashed.'\n\nThe court heard that the witness then made his way to the passenger side of the vehicle, where he saw a hand sticking out of the wreckage. \n\nHe said: 'She said she was dying. I told her she would be alright and that I wasn't going anywhere, just to calm her down and make her feel at ease as much as I could.'\n\nProsecutor Charles Miskin QC asked Mr Prince if Mrs Walters, who was aged 48, had said anything else.\n\n'No, other than that she couldn't breathe,' Mr Prince replied. 'She kept on telling me that and she kept on saying that she was dying.'\n\nThe trial, which may last for up to a month, was adjourned until next week.\n\n \n\nSorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article."," Ian Walters veered his pick-up truck off M1 when 'very angry', court told.

In Norway, which pays the highest benefits in Europe, almost 80% of people wanted a job. In Estonia, one of least generous, only around 40% did\n\nIn Norway in particular, which pays the highest benefits in Europe, almost 80 per cent of people wanted a job, \n\nBy contrast in Estonia, one of the least generous countries, only around 40 per cent did.\n\nThe survey was carried out by sociologists Dr Kjetil van der Wel and Dr Knut Halvorsen from Oslo and Akershus University College. \n\nThey examined responses to the statement: 'I would enjoy having a paid job even if I did not need the money' put to the interviewees for the European Social Survey in 2010.\n\nPeople who are hungry are more inclined to support of the welfare state policies that help the poor.  \n\nThe extraordinary results of a recent study from Aarhus University found that the state of our bodies has a significant influence on our position on specific political issues.\n\nResearchers said people's support for apparently altruistic policies of wealth redistribution is not so much a reflection of concern for the poor but 'rather a strategy for securing further resources for themselves.'\n\nAnd they their findings could revolutionise perceptions of how people come to adopt a political stance, with our ideological views apparently swayed by basic biology. \n\nThese responses were then compared with the amount the countries spent on welfare benefits and employment schemes, while taking into account the population differences between the member states. \n\nThe UK was average for the generosity of benefits, which was reflected in the percentage of people agreeing with the statement at almost 60 per cent.\n\nThe researchers also found that governments that intervene  to help the unemployed find work made people in general more likely to agree that they wanted work even if they didn't need the money.\n\n'Many scholars and commentators fear that generous social benefits threaten the sustainability of the welfare state due to work norm erosion, disincentives to work and dependency cultures,' the researchers said in the paper, 'The bigger the worse? A comparative study of the welfare state and employment commitment'.\n\n'A basic assumption is that if individuals can obtain sufficient levels of well-being - economic, social and psychological - from living off public benefits, compared to being employed, they would prefer the former. \n\nThe UK was average for the generosity of benefits and this was reflected in the percentage of people wanting to work - at 60% (stock image pictured). The study also found that governments that intervene to help the unemployed find work made people more likely to say they wanted work even if they didn't need the money\n\n'When a 'critical mass' of individuals receive public benefits rather than engaging in paid work, the norms regulating work and benefit behaviour will weaken, setting off a self-reinforcing process towards the 'self-destruction' of the welfare state.  \n\nThey also said that this may be because people who receive generous benefits when out of work may feel more inclined to give something back to the state by striving hard to find work. \n\n'The notion that big welfare states are associated with widespread cultures of dependency, or other adverse consequences of poor short term incentives to work, receives little support.' \n\nThe paper was published in the journal Work, Employment and Society."," A Europe-wide survey of 19,000 people revealed that the more a country paid to the unemployed, the more likely its residents were to want a job.

Perhaps that's incorrect. The migrant crisis that has suddenly drawn hundreds of journalists to Sicily has been brewing for years, but in the past 10 days, with as many as 1,600 deaths in the Mediterranean, suddenly minds are focused -- for now.\n\nAlmost exactly four years ago, in Libya, I caught, perhaps, a glimpse of what was to come.\n\nIt was late at night in the besieged city of Misrata. Hundreds of African migrants were caught between the Libyan civil war (back then some optimistically called it a ""revolution"") and the deep blue sea. They had come to Misrata from Ghana, Nigeria and elsewhere, hoping to board rickety boats to cross the sea to Europe.\n\nThey had been pinned down under sporadic shelling from government forces, but weren't welcome by the rebels who controlled the city. They appealed to us to help them escape.\n\nWe could do nothing, but they may have eventually found their way out when the fighting subsided.\n\nThe fall of Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi's regime, which we reporters covered so avidly, was followed by chaos, which we in the news media largely neglected, focused as we journalists were on the next catastrophe, the Syrian civil war. In that chaos, the business of human trafficking has boomed.\n\nAnd now that boom in human misery is coming in waves to the shores of Italy. The focus today is on those lost at sea. Aware of the tragedy underway, however, Italians are alarmed at the prospect that this year alone as many as a million migrants could arrive in Europe, according to one European Union official.\n\nThat is certainly the case in the Sicilian port of Catania, where many migrants arrive. The city's mayor, Enzo Bianco, insists city residents bear no ill will toward the migrants, but says Catania, and Sicily cannot absorb the ever-growing numbers. The rest of Europe must help carry the burden.\n\n""If something serious isn't done,"" he warns, ""dramas like these will be repeated. This problem will not be resolved by hiding our heads in the sand.""\n\nIncreasingly, some Italians are losing their patience. Two northern regions, Veneto and Valle d'Aosta, have declared they will no longer accept new migrants. The rightist Lega Nord has made opposition to new migrants a pillar of its party program.\n\nOthers, however, insist Italy must keep its doors open. In Catania port, I spoke with Grazia Giurato, who had joined a small protest in solidarity with the migrants.\n\n""Many years ago, our grandparents emigrated,"" she recalled. ""Let's keep that in mind.""\n\nIndeed, in tougher times, millions of impoverished Italians left their homeland to settle in the Americas and Australia. They, too, like the migrants from Africa and the Middle East, were fleeing grinding poverty and war. And they, too, experienced the kind of prejudice and resentment in lands their descendants now proudly call home.\n\nThat's the long view, perhaps. But now, today, Italians are grappling to deal with the consequences of an array of old and new ills, ranging from failing states and failing economies to endemic corruption, hopeless poverty, oppression and injustice that no one state or group of states can solve without a gargantuan, expensive and politically daunting effort.\n\nAnd while this crisis has been brewing for years, it is now truly upon us.", Hundreds of desperate migrants have died attempting to cross the Mediterranean in recent says. And Italians are alarmed that this year as many as a million migrants could arrive in Europe.,"['Missing details, says information not in the post.']",0.4492179357890205,0.1194965502061095,0.38068352710336767,0.9999999999999999,0.18850324462161377,0.37922408035747257,0.0,0.5755501952026889,0.3851346955742604,0.0,0.4316717411101153,0.5957131497660725,0.3846922972495399,0.5510925662605608,0.16794477583150177,0.1396303552358544,0.40059513276081005,0.1972001013646324,0.16993240622388084,0.5297929670179746,0.19916113787968748,0.1720199518302727,0.6000374289106938

A documentary filmmaker is currently working on a film about Yelp, which she says will unveil shady advertising practices at the company. Above, Yelp CEO Jeremy Stoppelman in August 2014\n\nPay to play: Billion Dollar Bully is still in production, but filmmaker Kaylie Milliken says she's already interviewed several small businesses who believe they've been targeted by the company for refusing to advertise\n\n'Businesses feel extorted,' Milliken told Daily Mail Online. 'After they decline advertising services from Yelp they feel like their good reviews get filtered out and their negative reviews come to the front.' \n\nAnd at hundreds of dollars a month for advertising, the price to work with Yelp is too big for many mom and pop businesses, Milliken says.\n\nMilliken first started investigating the company a year ago, when she went to see her doctor, who started talking about her negative experiences being listed on Yelp.\n\n'The more she talked about it, the more my jaw just kind of dropped. I knew that they had aggressive salespeople - my husband is a small -business owner and he's complained before about how pushy they can be. But then she started telling me about receiving reviews, really negative reviews by clients, and she couldn't figure out who these clients were. \n\n'She was really upset over it. And then she received a review where the client listed ailments about themsel[f] that she had never seen before, and this was the day after she had gotten off the phone with someone from Yelp,' Milliken told International Business Times. \n\nTense: Last month, filmmaker Milliken (right) appeared on CNBC to speak about the movie. Yelp spokeswoman Shannon Eis (left) also appeared on the show to defend the company \n\nLast month, Milliken released a trailer for her documentary in an attempt to fund the rest of the film's production. The day after the trailer was released, Yelp stock dipped four per cent. \n\nFollowing the stock drop, Yelp issued a statement to Business Insider, fiercely denying the claims in the trailer. \n\n'There is no merit to the claims they appear to highlight, which have been repeatedly dismissed by courts of law, investigated by government regulators, including the FTC, and disproven by academic study,' the company said. \n\nOn the contrary, Yelp says its algorithm protects businesses, by weeding out potentially fraudulent posts seeking to boost a company's rating or drag it down. As a result, only about 75 per cent of posts are approved for posting on the site while the rest remain in a partially-hidden 'filtered reviews' section on each businesses' page.\n\n'Because businesses have attempted to manipulate their ratings and those of their competitors by trying to post fake reviews, we have to protect consumers and honest businesses by preventing this behavior. As a result, Yelp has automated recommendation software in place to go through the more than 71 million reviews that have been submitted to Yelp to select the most useful and reliable content,' the company said in a statement to Daily Mail Online. \n\nYelp's company spokesman Shannon Eis went on CNBC to speak out against the documentary in a segment with Milliken, to further illustrate how the company's business practices have been backed by both the courts and independent investigations. \n\nHowever, the Harvard Business School study that the Eis cited in Yelp's defense wasn't solely focused on whether advertising impacts the ratings of businesses listed on the site - rather the investigation was designed to find out how many of the reviews on the site were fake. \n\nWhile the study's authors did find that businesses that advertise on the site are no more likely to have extreme 1 or 5-star ratings than any other business, they made it clear that Yelp's advertising practices were not the topic of their study and therefore their research was not exhaustive.\n\n'While our analysis provides some suggestive evidence against the theory that Yelp favors advertisers, we stress that it is neither exhaustive, nor conclusive. It is beyond the scope of this paper, and outside the capacity of our dataset to evaluate all the ways in which Yelp could favor advertisers,' the paper reads. \n\nStanding up: Milliken says that most of the business owners she spoke to were too afraid to appear on camera, for fear of retaliation fro Yelp. Pictured on the left interviewing a business owner, in a photo posted to her production company's website \n\nWork to be done: The Kickstarter campaign to fund Milliken's project reached its $60,000 goal. She plans to resume filming in May and have a rough cut by fall \n\nMilliken says she doesn't place much faith in these cases or investigations, after interviewing several small business owners in the course of her research. \n\n'One company began to advertise with Yelp, but then stopped when their contract came up. The next month they went from five stars to four stars, and then three stars. That story is so common. It happens over and over again and a lot of businesses feel so frustrated at this point,' Milliken told Daily Mail Online.\n\nMilliken says that these business owners were so afraid of Yelp that about 80 per cent of them refused to go on camera for fear of retaliation on their own Yelp pages - which they are not allowed to opt out of. \n\nIn their CNBC talk, Eis also accused Milliken of having a conflict of interest, since she had created several Yelp accounts to write fake reviews of businesses - including her husband's law practice. \n\nMilliken admitted to setting up the accounts, but said they were part of her research for the project. \n\n'I think it's shocking and very telling that this billion dollar corporation has come after this grassroots production company - where there are only two of us - creating a documentary that were still in production over...and Yelp has fired back with all that...I think it does clearly show that they are concerned about what will be coming out in the documentary,' Milliken said on CNBC. \n\nDaily Mail Online reached out to Yelp for evidence of the allegedly fake reviews Milliken wrote, and the company sent screen grabs that show several accounts tied to the filmmaker and the fact that she commented on her husband's business page.\n\nWhile the 5-star reviews appear to be dated in 2011 (before Milliken says she started working on the documentary), Yelp did not provide copies of the actual reviews. \n\nMilliken says she reached out to Yelp for a sit-down interview, but that CEO Jeremy Stoppelman declined. In a statement, the company spokesman explained why they decided to pass on speaking to Milliken.\n\n'Given that the title of the documentary already declares Yelp a bully before production and with a clear disregard for highly credible conclusions, we can be quite certain that our CEO's participation and any objective facts will not be fairly heard. We don't believe Mrs. Milliken is interested in the truth, considering she's shown such a disregard for it so far,' the statement reads. \n\nProst Production's Kickstarter campaign reached its $60,000 funding goal, and Milliken says she will resume filming in May with plans to finish the project in fall so that she can submit it to the Sundance Film Festival."," Billion Dollar Bully, an upcoming documentary, focuses on the review site's impact on small businesses . Filmmaker Kaylie Milliken spoke to several business owners who believe their Yelp ratings went down after they declined to advertise on the site. The company has denied the allegations, citing court rulings, an FTC investigation and a Harvard study as validation of their business practices.",['This summary is a good representation of the article.'],1.0,1.0,1.0,0.9999999999999999,0.7653479189149306,0.13205126127151978,0.18773542672399265,0.8763304471259805,0.24869454323320317,0.0,0.39994769102510197,0.43057642475989366,0.5871681732101521,0.5701894816955821,0.13709998579491747,0.11217706953119333,0.7245367937436827,0.11978955516153003,0.10202700144585394,0.4153620519117294,0.11361831537017797,0.09728128954229724,0.47875689677812394

She admitted that it has not always easy integrating him into her existing family, but she said it was worth it.\n\nSince August, Davion has been spending weekends with Connie and her daughters, Sydney, 21, Carley, 17, and with her adopted son Taylor, who is now 14.\n\nThen in December, Going took the steps to begin the adoption process and Davion moved with the rest of the family into a larger home. \n\nSince then there have fights and tables have been flipped, but in the end everyone loves one another, and she is prepared for the challenges.\n\n'I'm okay with messy and difficult,' she told the Tampa Bay Times. 'You just have to have your armor on all the time, but it's more than worth it. And every day things get a little bit better.' \n\nDavion became an example of the struggle faced by many teenagers in the system when in 2013 he stood up and told worshipers at his church: 'My name is Davion and I've been in foster care since I was born. I know God hasn't given up on me, so I'm not giving up either.'\n\nHe then said: 'I'll take anyone. Old or young, dad or mom, black, white, purple. I don't care. And I would be really appreciative. The best I could be.'\n\nDavion Only, 16, has been adopted by his old case worker, Connie Bell Going in Florida (above). She has known the teen since he was seven years old. Davion had been in the foster care system his entire life\n\nDavion (above) captured hearts  in 2013 when he made a plea in front of a St Petersburg church congregation for a family to 'love him forever'\n\nMost of all, Davion said he just wanted a family that would 'love him forever'.\n\nMillions of people around the country soon heard about Davion's story, and the young boy was even interviewed by Barbara Walters on The View, which all eventually led to him being adopted by a minister in Ohio and his family.\n\nThat is until Davion got into a fight with one of the other children, and the minister sent him back to Florida, and back to live in the foster care system.\n\nAfter Davion returned, people kept asking Going what it was that went wrong and caused him to be sent back after just three months.\n\n'That boy spent his whole life in the system, that's what went wrong,' she said.\n\nMaking matters worse, Davion and Miss Connie, as he calls her, did not speak when he came back to Florida.\n\nDavion had cut himself off from other people, playing video games as he quickly went through four different homes and four schools in less than year.\n\nDavion Only (pictured above with Connie Going at the church where he made his speech in 2013) was adopted by a minister in Ohio but sent back into the system a few months later when he fought with one of the minister's children\n\nGoing says she had begun to call him numerous times, but he always hung up the phone.\n\nThen, one night last July, Davion called up Miss Connie and asked her the question he had been asking since they first met when he was only a little boy.\n\n'Do you remember what I asked you before?' he said. 'Well, how do you feel about adopting me now?'\n\nFor the first time since he had asked, Going was finally able to give him the answer he wanted to hear.\n\nThe 52-year-old case worker has three children of her own, one adopted and two biological daughters, and was a single mother, but she was no longer Davion's case worker, which made the process easier.\n\nFrom August through December he started spending more and more time with the family, a perfect fit as he was already close to Going's adopted son Taylor.\n\nThen, in December, Going got a lawyer and began the process of adopting Davion. \n\nDavion Only (pictured above in church three years ago) called and asked Miss Connie if she would adopt him last July\n\nDavion got his first bedroom, his first set of siblings, and, most importantly, the one thing he had been hoping for all along.\n\n'I guess I always thought of you as my mom,' Davion said to Going last December. 'Only now I get to call you that for real, right?' \n\nDavion officially became part of the family in February however, when after he and Going celebrated their birthdays, which fall on the same date, they went home and sat around the table for cake with his three siblings and signed the court papers.\n\nAfter 16 years Davion was finally home. \n\nWhat's more, because of that day in September 2013 when Davion stepped up on the pulpit, hundreds of others have been adopted as well. \n\n'I guess I always thought of you as my mom,' Davion (above in 2013) said to Going last December"," Davion Only, 16, captured hearts around the nation in 2013 when he made a plea for a family to 'love him forever' Later this month he will officially be adopted by his old caseworker Connie Bell Going and her family.

For workers aged 50 to 64, pay rises plunge to a meagre 1.2 per cent, official figures show – significantly below the UK average of 2.1 per cent.\n\nThe Office for National Statistics revealed in its latest Economic Review that the under-25s are five times as likely to have moved jobs in the past three months than workers over-50.\n\nBut while younger workers often receive greater pay rises because they move jobs more frequently, official data shows that the gap is widening.\n\nIn 2009, Britain's youngest workers received pay rises three times greater than older workers, but this has now widened to nine times greater. \n\nIn the last three months of 2014, 5.4 per cent of 18-25-year-olds changed jobs, compared to only 1.2 per cent of 50-64-year-olds\n\nExperts said the growing gulf between the generations could signal a reluctance by employers to train and promote older members of staff. Ros Altmann, a Whitehall adviser on older workers, said: 'Younger people's pay is rising faster than average and the rate of increase is accelerating.\n\n'It could be because younger people are the most likely to receive training, with employers keen to focus on the newer workers and spending far less on training older workers.\n\n'With the pace of change in technology and processes being so rapid nowadays, the need for ongoing training is more important than ever, so people do not fall behind in terms of pay and productivity.'\n\nLabour leader Ed Miliband today renewed his attack on the government, claiming the Tories 'believe in the old idea that as long as the rich and powerful are OK then everyone else will succeed'\n\nShe also criticised the Government for subsidising training for under-25s, 'so that employers find it much cheaper to train youngsters than older workers'.\n\nShe added: 'The increase in pay for younger workers is great news and shows they are progressing well. On the other hand, those who are in their later years seem less likely to be treated so generously and have not been able to enjoy the same kind of pay growth as younger colleagues.'\n\nLisa Harris, at over-50s specialist firm Saga, said: 'Many older workers have spent years climbing the career ladder and are more likely to value the job satisfaction and security of doing the job they know well over the pursuit of more money.\n\n'However, it's important that employers properly value the contribution and commitment of older workers and ensure they are fairly paid for the job they do and are not taken advantage of.'"," Workers aged 18-25 saw wages rise eight times faster than over 50s. In three months, 5.4% of 18-25-year-olds changed jobs, 1.2% aged 50-64.

'They've been very impressive in the semi-classics. Can they finish it off by winning a big one?'\n\nTeam Sky's focus on the Grand Tours up to now has left them short of riders equipped to win classics, while the usually chaotic nature of the races is anathema to their favoured controlling tactics.\n\nBut the development of Stannard and Thomas gives Team Sky two in-house contenders, while Wiggins raised eyebrows with his ninth-placed finish in Paris-Roubaix last year and he vowed to return. Luke Rowe could also be another British option for the team.\n\nIan Stannard (3rd from front) rides in the Gent-Wevelgem one-day cycling race on March 29\n\nInjuries to classics specialists Fabian Cancellara (Trek Factory) and Tom Boonen (Etixx-QuickStep) - although the latter may return in time for Paris-Roubaix - add to the impression that Team Sky's best chance may be now.\n\n'Without Cancellara, without Boonen, it's going to be a more open race,' said Kelly, who will commentate on both the Tour of Flanders and Paris-Roubaix for Eurosport.\n\n'There's going to be eight-10 guys saying they can win and Sky have three of them. Geraint is certainly in there, Stannard is maybe a little bit under his best after his crash (in the first Monument, Milan-San Remo on March 22) but can come back, and then of course there is Wiggins.'\n\nOf the three, Wiggins is yet to show the sort of form this season which suggests he can win Paris-Roubaix, but Kelly is not counting the 2012 Tour de France winner out, saying a Monument win to add to his Tour and world time trial success would elevate Wiggins to 'another level'.\n\n'If you look at the way he's performing at the moment, for me, it's not as good as I would like him to be in the recent races, but you can't go to Paris-Roubaix with only one card to play,' Kelly said.\n\nGeraint Thomas celebrates placing third in the Belgian cycling classic Ghent-Wevelgem\n\n'With Thomas and Stannard as well, you play all of those cards and the rest look after them. If you can get to the final 10-12km and Wiggins is still there, that is where he can go on the attack.'\n\nTo get to that point, Team Sky will need to be in survival mode in a usually attritional race known as 'the Hell of the North'.\n\nThe brutal cobbled stretches, which require huge amounts of effort while increasing the chances of crashes and mechanical problems, create a nervousness in the peloton which makes planning all but impossible.\n\nAlthough Kelly never won the Tour of Flanders, finishing second in 1984, he was victorious in Paris-Roubaix twice, 1984 and 1986, and said the fear of the cobbles is something that never really left him.\n\n'When I first went there I had a horrendous time - I was very nervous on the cobbles and I wasn't able to ride them well,' he said. 'I slowly developed and I was able to manage to ride them, but even when I got to the point of being a Paris-Roubaix favourite it's still very nervous times.\n\n'It's a horrible race to ride, but a great race to win.'", Team Sky have never won one of cycling's five Monument races. The Tour of Flanders takes place next weekend with Ian Stannard and Geraint Thomas contenders fro Team Sky.

I asked him about the science behind climate change and public health and the message he wants the average American to take away, as well as how enforceable his action plan is.\n\nHere are five things I learned:\n\nThe President enrolled at Occidental College in Los Angeles in 1979 (he transferred to Columbia University his junior year). While in L.A., he said, the air was so bad that it prevented him from running outside. He remembers the air quality alerts and how people with respiratory problems had to stay inside.\n\nHe credits the Clean Air Act with making Americans ""a lot"" healthier, in addition to being able to ""see the mountains in the background because they aren't covered in smog.""\n\nObama also said the instances of asthma and other respiratory diseases went down after these measures were taken.\n\nPeer-reviewed Environmental Protection Agency studies say that the Clean Air Act and subsequent amendments have reduced early deaths associated with exposure to ambient fine particle pollution and ozone, and reduced illnesses such as chronic bronchitis and acute myocardial infarction. The EPA estimates that, between 1970 and 2010, the act and its amendments prevented 365,000 early deaths from particulate matter alone.\n\n""No challenge poses more of a public threat than climate change,"" the President told me.\n\nWhen I asked about the strength of the science supporting the direct relationship between climate change and public health, he said, ""We know as temperatures rise, insect-borne diseases potentially start shifting up. We know, in a very straight-forward fashion, that heatstroke and other heat-related illnesses and deaths potentially increase, and so what we're doing here is to make sure that in addition to public awareness around the potential for big storms like Hurricane Sandy or big wildfires or droughts, that people recognize there's a very personal, potential impact in climate change, and the good news is we can do something about it.""\n\nIn many ways, Obama is attempting to reframe the discussion around climate change as a public health issue that affects all of us, while conceding that we don't fully understand the magnitude of the correlation between rising temperatures and impact on human health.\n\nWhen asked what the average American can do about all this, the President encouraged ordinary citizens, doctors and nurses to start putting some pressure on elected officials ""to try and make something happen to reduce the impacts of climate change."" He also issued a presidential proclamation declaring April 6-12 as National Public Health Week ""to better understand, communicate and reduce the health impacts of climate change on our communities.""\n\nThe average American can also do their part to reduce their own carbon footprint, including:\n\n• Change your incandescent light bulbs to compact fluorescent lights. One CFL can reduce up to 1,300 pounds of carbon dioxide pollution during its lifetime. If every house in the U.S. switched its bulbs, we could reduce the electricity spent on lighting by half.\n\n• Unplug your gadgets and chargers when not in use. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, this practice can save $100 a year on your energy bill.\n\n• Use a laptop instead of a desktop. Laptops are designed to be energy-efficient, because battery life is a major factor in their design. According to Energy Star, a laptop can be up to 80% more energy-efficient than a desktop.\n\n• Filter your own water. Beyond the environmental toll of plastic waste, consider just how far your water was transported before you bought it at the grocery store.\n\n• Adjust your curtains and thermostats. If you keep your house 2 degrees warmer in the summer and 2 degrees colder in the winter, you can save big bucks on your energy bill. The Department of Energy estimates you can save up to 15% on your bill by turning off your thermostat when you're not at home.\n\nObama did not appear particularly concerned about the current Supreme Court challenge to the Affordable Care Act. He  said he believes the statute is ""clear and straightforward."" He said, ""I am not anticipating the Supreme Court would make such a bad decision.""\n\nAt issue is the 32 states that did not set up their own health care exchanges and left it to the federal government to do so.\n\nThe plaintiffs in the lawsuit contend that the language of the Affordable Care Act does not allow for tax subsidies in those states (without state-based exchanges), possibly creating a situation, for example, in which people in Massachusetts would receive a tax credit, but people living in Texas would not.\n\nObama did tell me that if the Supreme Court challenge is upheld, however, there is no Plan B.\n\n""Millions of people would lose their health insurance. They would no longer be able to afford the health insurance that's being provided out there.""\n\nObama went on to say, ""I think this is the last gasp of folks who have been fighting against [the Affordable Care Act] for ideological reasons.""\n\nHe told me that he ""gets letters every day from people who say, 'you know what, the Affordable Care Act saved my life or saved my kid's life because I got insurance.' 'I thought I was healthy; turns out I had a tumor, but because I went and got a checkup, it was removed in time, and I'm now cancer-free.' ""\n\nHe added, ""I think stories like that will be factored in when the Supreme Court takes a look at this case.""\n\nCNN's Ben Tinker contributed to this report."," ""No challenge poses more of a public threat than climate change,"" the President says. He credits the Clean Air Act with making Americans ""a lot"" healthier.",['should also summarize the 5 things the average American can also do their part to reduce their own carbon footprint.\\n\\n'],0.4492179357890205,1.0,0.38068352710336767,0.9999999999999999,0.39495863559844735,0.5394952233930065,0.0,0.6000263069668401,0.08933773205232887,0.0,0.1130370385574192,0.997120124135241,0.42493767470797117,0.7673544156047392,0.031072233738879573,0.0239624849919291,1.0,0.13720186202254162,0.11381928240975467,0.9600532078174562,0.016508282804061386,0.01377903023358927,0.5138123419632956

I'm not comfortable with the idea of subsidising people who put kids' health at risk,' he said.\n\n'Childcare support should go to people who are doing the right thing by their child and the children they play with.

However a loophole currently allows parents who do not vaccinate their children from accessing the funds .

China's appetite for endangered wildlife and the 2,000-year practice of Traditional Chinese Medicine is the main catalyst behind the world's third-largest illicit trade\n\nGuangzhou is the richest and most powerful city in southern China, with a keen taste for exotic animals and plants, seen as extreme even in other regions of China.\n\nThe main reason for this is 2,000-year-old Traditional Chinese Medicine that lists curative qualities in thousands of rare and exotic animals, such as the Sumatran Tiger.   \n\nThe pursuit of these traditions is the driving force behind the $20 billion (£13bn) illegal wildlife network, the worlds third largest elicit trade, surpassed only by arms and drugs.\n\nThe network activity intensifies in South East Asia home to rich biodiversity, well developed transport infrastructures, high profit margins and lax law enforcement, a haven for wildlife smugglers. \n\nVietnamese authorities recently seized a record haul of smuggled wildlife including two tons of tiger bones, bear paws and gall bladders. \n\nBrutal@ Crocodile farmers prepare to remove live organs from an illegally traded Vietnamese Crocodile.

The choice at this election is clear. Lower taxes under David Cameron. Or higher taxes under Ed Miliband and the SNP.'\n\nMr Balls insisted that Labour will not raise VAT, national insurance or the basic and higher rates of income tax if it wins the general election. But he confirmed that the party would restore the 50p top rate for earnings over £150,000, as well as imposing a mansion tax, a levy on tobacco companies and closing tax loopholes.\n\nMr Clegg hit out at both sides and warned only his party can ensure a balanced plan to clear the deficit. He said millions of people would get a tax cut worth almost £400 from a Liberal Democrat pledge to push the income tax personal allowance to £12,500. \n\nBy contrast, Labour's plan to reintroduce the 10p starter rate of income tax would be worth just £37 to taxpayers.\n\n'Labour's short-term economic plan will lead to mounting borrowing and leave taxpayers short by hundreds of pounds, which is unfair and reckless,' said Mr Clegg, who was campaigning in Kingston-upon-Thames and the South West.\n\n'Ed Balls and Ed Miliband's tax plans are economically illiterate.\n\nLabour has already failed to commit the £8 billion needed for the NHS, and are now failing to give taxpayers the tax cut they deserve.'\n\nMr Clegg met Elise Popperwell - aged just seven months - and her mother Melissa Popperwell while out campaigning in Surbiton\n\nMr Balls said: 'All of our plans are fully costed and paid for. None of our manifesto commitments will require a single pound of extra borrowing ...\n\n'So this is the choice at the election, a choice between a Conservative Party which has a track record of breaking their promises on VAT and will raise it again after the election or a Labour Party which has never raised VAT and will not raise VAT in the next Parliament.\n\n'A Tory way which means millions pay more while millionaires pay less, or Labour's plan to back millions of working people, save our NHS and balance the books in a fair way.'\n\nElsewhere on the campaign trail, Ukip leader Nigel Farage was concentrating on his own constituency of South Thanet, where a weekend poll suggested he was trailing in second place in the close three-way marginal.\n\nOn a campaign visit to Surbiton, south-west London, Mr Clegg said that Liberal Democrats had blocked Tory plans to cut the top rate of income tax from 50p to 40p during the coalition.\n\nConservative ministers were 'always more interested in tax cuts for people at the top rather than tax cuts for people at the bottom or the middle', Mr Clegg told Sky News.\n\n'I was very amused yesterday to hear George Osborne and David Cameron saying with earnest sincerity that they had no plan of giving further tax cuts to people at the top because, I tell you, they had exactly that plan in government and it was something that we said we would not go along with.'\n\nMr Clegg's comments came after Lib Dem Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander told The Independent that during coalition negotiations over tax cuts, a Conservative minister told him: 'You take care of the workers and we'll take care of the bosses.'"," Labour  unveils poster claiming voters lost £1,100 each due to tax changes.

She also has the part-time job of being Captain of the French Fed Cup team, who are in action next weekend.\n\nMauresmo has never made any secret of the fact that the travel is the part of the job that least appeals to her, and that will inevitably become more complicated with a baby on board. Already it must be very questionable whether she would be at the US Open which begins at the end of the August, although there has been no comment on this from either her or Murray, who has been up in Scotland ahead of tying the knot with Kim Sears in Dunblane.\n\nMurray's current coach Amelie Mauresmo has recently announced that she is expecting a baby \n\nMauresmo, pictured at this year's Australian Open, may have to alter her coaching schedule after the birth\n\nIt is understood that the 27 year-old Scot has known about Mauresmo' s pregnancy for a number of weeks, but he was anyway planning on linking up with Bjorkman – the former world singles No 4 and doubles No 1 – prior to that.\n\nAs Sportsmail reported as far back as nearly a year ago, the Swede was on Murray's shortlist to replace Ivan Lendl before he settled on the former Wimbledon women's champion as part of a groundbreaking move.\n\nA personable and intelligent man still actively involved in the game, and as someone who made the absolute best of his natural ability, he was someone the Scot identified as prime coaching material.\n\nMurray has been planning to work with former world No 3 Jonas Bjorkman as an assistant coach\n\nThe Swede, pictured winning Wimbledon with Todd Woodbridge, is a former world No 1 doubles player\n\nLast week in Miami Murray reported that the two of them had recently spent two hours on the phone together, and he has not been able to join up before because he has been involved with Sweden's version of Strictly Come Dancing.\n\n'The time flew by,' the British No 1 said of their highly satisfactory conversation. It would be a major surprise if they somehow did not get along, or if he did not fit in with others in the team, including Mauresmo.\n\nJust where this leaves the player and his 35 year-old head coach will be for the two of them to work out. The softly-spoken Mauresmo is a very private person who prefers to keep a low profile on the tennis side of things, let alone on matters to do with her personal life.\n\nBjorkman could have a key part to play in Murray's quest to reclaim the Wimbledon title he won in 2013\n\nShe is known to have been accompanied by a girlfriend on trips with Murray to Australia and America this year, who stays in the background to the point where she has been near enough invisible.\n\nHowever pleased Murray will be for his coach on a personal basis – and there is no question they have become very close – he might also feel that the last thing he needs is any further complication or upheaval within his support team.\n\nHis form has been good this year after all the disruptions and departures of last season, and Bjorkman appeared to be the last piece slotting into place.

At Waterloo Napoleon did surrender,' sang Sweden's fab four in their famous Eurovision Song Contest winner. \n\nNow this may come as a surprise, but you would be well advised not to rely on Abba to help with your history homework.\n\nIf Benny and Bjorn actually laboured under this surrendering misapprehension when they wrote their song (songwriters are not hot on facts – happy to say anything as long as it rhymes), they would have discovered the truth when they subsequently paid a visit to the Wellington Museum in Waterloo, just south of Brussels in Belgium.\n\nView of Hougoumont farmhouse from The Lion's Mound or Butte du Lion on the battlefield of Waterloo, Belgium\n\nJudging by the photo of Abba's visit, prominently on view in the museum, the group seems to have been treated to a rapturous limousine procession through the town. \n\nMy, my: the people of Waterloo must have been delighted.\n\nNapoleon certainly didn't surrender at Waterloo. \n\nThere was a long day's fighting on that June day in 1815 and a very shaky start for the UK team, but thanks to some late-arriving Prussian assistance, the boy Wellington eventually done good.\n\nWhen Napoleon saw that things were going badly, he hot-footed it to Paris, where he later abdicated.\n\nShortly afterwards, Boney was taken by the British to the remote Atlantic isle of St Helena, where he died six years later in circumstances that merited the forensic attentions of a Miss Marple.\n\n'Waterloo' quickly entered the English language as a synonym for 'a decisive defeat'. But while the British know what happened when Napoleon met his Waterloo, the French-speaking world is less convinced.\n\nBattle of Waterloo reenactors stand in historic costume, with rifles and flags\n\nBelgium is divided into two halves: Flemish-speaking and French-speaking. \n\nIt is unfortunate for anniversary-celebrating purposes that Waterloo lies in the French half where the locals are preparing to mark the bicentenary of the Battle of Waterloo – with Napoleon as the unchallenged star of the show.\n\nLocal Anglo-Belgian entrepreneur Anthony Martin has invested a substantial financial stake in plans for marking the anniversary by turning a Templar hospice on the edge of the battlefield into a magnificent restaurant-cum-brewery (where he brews Waterloo beer, of course) and a museum looking at the surgical side of the battle (not for the squeamish).\n\nIt would be fair to say that Mr Martin is not best pleased by the outbreak of Napoleon-worship. \n\nHe points to the poster advertising the re-enactment event which will be taking place this summer over four days from June 18 to 21; the photograph shows a giant, heroic Napoleon towering over the smaller, less impressive figures of Wellington and Prussian leader Blucher.\n\n'It's ridiculous,' says Mr Martin. 'The French-speaking world refuses to believe Napoleon lost the battle. \n\nA painting of the Battle of Waterloo; 2015 marks the 200th anniversary of the battle\n\nAs far as they're concerned, he scored some sort of moral victory. He lost. But they won't accept it.'\n\nHowever, the French-speaking world – and especially the French – don't figure very significantly in the numbers of tourists who visit the famous battlefield site every year. \n\nThe British – and the English-speaking nations of the world – remain fascinated by the victory and the bloody manner in which it was achieved.\n\nActually, horror-seeking tourists visited the battlefield almost before they had finished burying the bodies. \n\nPoet Lord Byron, something of a Bonaparte fan, suddenly found he had time to visit the battlefield when his lavish coach, modelled on Napoleon's battle carriage, broke down on his journey from the Channel to the south.\n\n'My, my! At Waterloo Napoleon did surrender!' Abba pictured in the town of Waterloo, Belgium in 1974\n\nIn a Top Gear moment, Byron treated himself to a charge across the battleground on a large Cossack horse he had hired, making himself perhaps the first battlefield tourist. \n\nHard on his heels came Poet Laureate Robert Southey; Sir Walter Scott; the artist Turner; and, a few years later, William Wordsworth. \n\nIt's worth recalling that Wordsworth, as a young man, had welcomed the French Revolution ('Bliss was it in that dawn to be alive…') but rapidly shifted his political stance to somewhere far to the right of Attila the Hun.\n\nSoon Waterloo was established as one of the great continental sights. \n\nIt was British tourists visiting Waterloo who discovered the neglected city of Bruges – largely derelict after its access to the sea silted up – and helped to finance its restoration.\n\nThere was an unmistakable sense that Waterloo had been a defining moment in history: Europe had been reshaped and, the odd Franco-German conflict apart, peace reigned for a century.\n\nThe pleasure of the area around Waterloo is that in many ways it has barely changed.\n\nA statue sits atop the Lion's Mound, which commemorates the battlefield at Waterloo, Belgium\n\nIf you have time, follow the progress of the conflict along La Route Napoleon – what else? – from Beaumont, where he camped near the French border on June 14, to the fields south of Waterloo where he was defeated four days later.\n\nDespite facing superior forces with a hastily assembled army, it is extraordinary that Napoleon came very close to victory.\n\nWellington reflected: 'It has been a damned serious business. Blucher and I have lost 30,000 men – the nearest run thing you ever saw in your life...'\n\nUnbelievable for me was encountering the present Duke of Wellington in the flesh at Waterloo. \n\nHe was attending the opening ceremony for a new exhibition at the Wellington Museum on the 'Shared Destinies' of Wellington and Napoleon, who fought each other often but never met. It runs until the end of July.\n\nMy favourite exhibit is Lord Uxbridge's wooden leg. \n\nAt the end of the battle, Uxbridge was riding near Wellington when they came under cannon fire.\n\n'By God, sir, I've lost my leg!' announced Uxbridge, to which Wellington replied: 'By God, sir, so you have!' \n\nUxbridge was taken to the town of Waterloo, where his right leg was amputated above the knee.\n\nHis only recorded comment during the operation was: 'The knives appear somewhat blunt.' \n\nPresumably he had taken advantage of the pint of gin offered as anaesthetic to anyone facing an amputation.\n\nThe severed leg was buried behind the house and its grave became a tourist attraction. \n\nSadly it is no more, but you can see his wooden limb in the museum.\n\nPerhaps the most interesting sight on the battlefield is Hougoumont farm, whose heroic defence by the British is recognised as the pivotal moment of the battle.\n\nEfforts to restore the property and turn it into a museum were for a long time frustrated by lack of funds, but the project was rescued last year following the intervention of Chancellor George Osborne who, it turned out, was something of a battlefield enthusiast. \n\nAn injection of £1 million has ensured Hougoumont will open to the public for the first time for the celebrations in June, with guests able to stay in a self-catering cottage within the farm – and as far as I could tell from my visit last month, Hougoumont is a Napoleon-free zone.\n\nMay marks the 75th anniversary of Operation Dynamo, the evacuation of Allied troops from Dunkirk\n\nDunkirk\n\nWhile June marks the anniversary of a glorious victory, May sees the 75th anniversary of what has sometimes been referred to as a glorious failure: Operation Dynamo – the evacuation of Allied troops from the beaches near Dunkirk from May 26 to June 4, 1940.\n\nThe extraordinary rescue, the largest evacuation in military history, saw 338,226 soldiers brought home to England in the face of ferocious bombing from German aircraft. \n\nWalk along the wide beach at Zuydcoote, a 15-minute drive from the centre of Dunkirk, and at first glance there is little to hint at the awful scenes of death and destruction here 75 years ago.\n\nI was there with Bruno Pruvost, a diver who has explored the wrecks on and near the beach – some of the 336 'little ships' that set sail from England, answering the emergency call, but which never returned.\n\nAt low tide you can visit the wreck of the Crested Eagle, a Thames river cruiser that picked up 600 men from the beach but was then bombed by a Stuka. With his ship in flames, the captain beached the ship with the hope of saving as many of his passengers as possible,\n\nYou can find out more about the Crested Eagle and the other ships at the excellent Memorial du Souvenir at Dunkirk. \n\nAlso well worth visiting is the Fort des Dunes, built as part of a grand defensive line against possible German invasion in the 19th Century – and which played its part in the evacuation.\n\nBack on the beach at Zuydcoote, Bruno picked up a small black pellet from the beach: 'Coal from the bunkers of sunken ships – this gets washed up all the time.' \n\nThe sea is still giving up its war souvenirs.\n\nEurostar (eurostar.com, 08432 186186) offers nine daily services from London St Pancras International to Brussels from £72. \n\nTickets to other Belgian stations start from £82. \n\nHotel Pullman in Brussels (pullmanhotels.com) offers double rooms from about £73. \n\nVisit belgiumtheplaceto.be for further information on Brussels and Wallonia, and also waterloo2015.org for programme and tickets for the re-enactment. \n\nDFDS Seaways (dfdsseaways.co.uk, 0871 574 7235) sails up to 24 times a day between Dover and Dunkirk. \n\nPrices start from £39 each way for a car and up to nine people."," Contrary to the Abba  song, Napoleon did not surrender at Waterloo.

Parker transforms candid images of her daughter's adventures into an empowering photo series celebrating girls' strength\nA photographer and mother-of-two has turned a collection of candid images of her energetic daughters and their friends into a powerful photography series that celebrates their strength and confidence, while highlighting what it means to be a girl today.\n\nKate T. Parker, from Atlanta, Georgia, was inspired to create her aptly-titled series Strong is the New Pretty while pouring over photos she snapped of her daughters Ella, nine, and Alice, six, playing sports and enjoying their childhoods.\n\n'The project became about capturing my girls and their friends as they truly are and how that is OK -not only OK - but worthy of celebration,' she told Daily Mail Online in an email.\n\nSummer breeze: Atlanta-based photographer Kate T. Parker captured this group of girls cooling off in front of a fan for her photo series Strong is the New Pretty \n\nSerious athlete: Kate snapped these pictures of her daughter Ella, nine, before her first triathlon (L) and while she was playing soccer (R)\n\nTeam spirit: As a part of the powerful series, Ms Parker photographs her daughters and their friends playing sports\n\nMs Parker continued: 'There's a lot of pressure for girls - and women - to look a certain way, act in [a] certain manner, and I wanted to let my daughters know that who they naturally are is enough.'\n\nWhen the devoted parent first turned the camera lens on her girls she was hoping simply to record their childhood, as well as practice certain photography techniques, but about a year ago the project started to evolve into something more.\n\n'The images changed,' Ms Parker explained. 'I started to see patterns and recognize that the images where the girls were authentically captured were the strongest images. The images that showed the girls as they genuinely are were my favorites.'\n\nWater world: Ms Parker snapped this shot of the girls while they were enjoying a swimming session\n\nFeeling strong: Kate's daughter and her soccer teammates posed against a brick wall for this powerful shot\n\nHot wheels: Ms Parker's daughters can be seen riding around their neighborhood \n\nSisterly love: These young girls embraced while wearing matching uniforms\n\nWild woman: This little girl let out a delightful scream as she ran through sprinklers in her bathingsuit\n\nShe kept that idea in mind as she continued to shoot her daughters and their friends. The series of photos aims to empower the girls and honor their personal interests - whatever they may be.   \n\nThe images of Ella, Alice, and their friends are black and white and free of frilly dresses, dolls or anything else stereotypically associated with young girls. \n\nInstead, Ms Parker captured the girls playing sports, running through sprinklers and horsing around, essentially exploring their everyday adventures. \n\n'My girls know that who they are is just perfect,' she wrote on her blog last year.\n\nGirl fight: Ms Parker photographed her girls horsing around and playfully fighting like sisters typically do \n\nPowerful gaze: Ms Parker got close-up for this candid snapshot \n\nPeek-a-boo: These four girls can be seen posing inside a cardboard cutout \n\nUphill battle: This little girl rides her bike wearing a swimsuit and a helmet \n\nMs Parker added: 'They don't need to have their hair done, clothes matching, or even be clean to be loved or accepted... I wanted this series of images to show their boldness, their strength and the beauty in them, as they are. Strong is the new pretty.'\n\nThe photographer explained to Today that she is in no way 'taking out' girls who like traditionally feminine things. She has nothing against tutus or the color pink. In fact, she believes that parents should celebrate whatever their kids are into. \n\n'My kids are this, you know? Athletic and strong and dirty and loud and crazy,' she told the outlet. 'That's what I'm trying to celebrate.'\n\nMs Parker added: 'But I encourage everyone to document their own kids the way they see them.' \n\nGetting clean: The two girls give their dog a bath in this humorous shot \n\nKeeping pace: Ms Parker captured her daughter running a race\n\nHideout: Ms Parker snapped this photo of her daughter and her dog peeking their faces out of their play house\n\nAnimal instinct: The girls chose to stick their heads out the window while their dog remained inside \n\nWhen the Today show shared Ms Parker's story on their Facebook page yesterday, it was liked nearly 25,000 times and inspired hundreds of parents to post photos of their own daughters doing the things that they love. \n\n'Already a fierce little girl! Girls play in the mud and with sticks too!' Mary Kenyon wrote of her daughter.  \n\n'Determined and strong that's what all girls should be made of!' Cheryl Koscielniak Brzyski added. \n\nMeanwhile, Charlotte Yarbrough Knowles noted: 'My daughter is amazing. She is intelligent, funny and so filled with potential.

Gen. Chris Bogdan said: 'If one or two jets are flying together, they have been able to share information seamlessly.\n\n'But when there are four jets, communication problems emerge, which can 'create an inaccurate picture for the pilot.' \n\nThe Pentagon's astonishing estimate for the lifetime cost an F-35 is up almost $120billion from about year ago.\n\nBut it still plans to buy 2,443 of the warplanes that can evade radar detection and can reach well over supersonic speed.\n\nThe new estimate includes maintenance costs of around $1.1trillion over the plane's lifetime, the price of the aircraft itself which is $332billion and another $63.8billion for the engine.\n\nThe fighter jet's developers Lockhead Martin say 'the supersonic, multi-role F-35 represents a quantum leap' in airborne warfare.\n\nIts 'advanced stealth' allows it to fly over areas without being detected by sophisticated radar systems that other jets cannot.\n\nIts constructors claim it can be used for a range of missions which include air-to-air combat, ground strikes, electronic attack and even reconnaissance because it is such a versatile machine.\n\nIts 'advanced electronic warfare' function allow it to locate and track enemy forces and even jam their radars.\n\nThe state-of-the-art helmet - which costs $400,000 - give the pilot real-time access to battle space information with 360-degree coverage of their surroundings. \n\nThe F-35's stealth capabilities and ability to carry weapons inside it's airframe mean it can engage its targets from long-range without being detected.\n\nLockhead Martin says the F-35 'will enter the battlespace first, clearing the way' for  coalition forces.\n\nThe company describes it as the 'quarterback' for a joint strike force because it can share what it sees with other jets nearby, expanding the 'situational awareness across the entire network of aircraft'.","Six infrared cameras around the jet give pilots a complete 360 degree view.

That applies particularly to Bolasie, who scored a hat-trick in the demolition of Sunderland last week.\n\nYannick Bolasie (centre) of Crystal Palace celebrates scoring against Sunderland at the Stadium of Light\n\nAlan Pardew says Bolasie bidding will have to start at £20m for his star to leave Selhurst Park\n\nResponding to a question about Joel Ward's contract extension, Pardew said: 'It was good news for us this week (with Ward). We wanted to send a statement that our players will be very, very difficult to take away.\n\n'One, because they enjoy their football and two because we are going forward. Brede Hangeland said to me when he was at Fulham that he sensed that no one wanted to leave. (There was a report of a) £10m price on Bolasie. Blimey.\n\n'It needs to be more than double that to get near him. We are in a great financial position. I am not getting carried away with where we are but we are doing very well in the Premier League.'\n\nThat form includes four straight wins ahead of Tony Pulis's return to Selhurst Park on Saturday. Pardew believes Pulis should get a good reception at the club which he transformed last season before leaving days before this campaign started.\n\nBolasie scored a hat-trick in Crystal Palace's demolition of Sunderland last week away from home\n\n Pardew is demanding more than £20m for Bolasie to be taken away from Crystal Palace during the summer\n\nBut Pardew also indicated that his own job in lifting Palace this season had spared Pulis a potentially rocky return. He said: 'Tony achieved fantastic results here last season. For sure I wouldn't be here and a lot of these players wouldn't be here if he hadn't done that, so we are thankful to him.\n\n'He should also be thankful that we are in the position we are in, and that the players and myself have got the team where it is, because the reception could have been very different if we were in the relegations zone and leaving so shortly before the season started. I think that is good for him and he deserves that. Hopefully tomorrow he gets the reception that he warrants.'\n\nPardew has targeted a top-10 finish, saying: 'Top 10 is a realistic aim and then we want to build on that. The chairman has done a fantastic job. I will be banging his door down in the summer for some big signings.'\n\nBolasie scores against Sunderland as he helped Crystal Palace beat the struggling Premier League side",Yannick Bolasie scored a hat-trick against Sunderland last week.

A poor kid from Grand Rapids, Michigan, he has spent his adult life over-compensating for the deprivation he once knew.\n\nHe has tossed handfuls of $100 bills into the air at a strip club and hurled wads of cash into a swimming pool so he could amuse himself by watching girls dive to retrieve them. The mouthguard he will wear during 'The Fight of the Century' with Manny Pacquiao at the MGM Grand on Saturday night cost $25,000 and is inlaid with a $100 bill.\n\nFloyd Mayweather Jr is boxing's undisputed braggart - and a brilliant performer in the ring\n\nMayweather will take on Manny Pacquiao on Saturday in the most eagerly awaited fight of the century\n\nSome novelists like to assign names to their protagonists that reflect their character traits or their obsessions. Mayweather has saved everyone the trouble with his chosen nickname. John Self, meet Money Mayweather.\n\nMoney Mayweather reigned until the build-up to this fight began. Then, he took to referring to himself as TBE, or The Best Ever. He is better than Muhammad Ali and Sugar Ray Robinson ever were, Mayweather said this week.\n\nMayweather, it is also worth pointing out, has faced a string of accusations of violence against women and spent two months in the Clark County Detention Center in 2012 for a domestic violence conviction.\n\nAlthough the fight is not quite the struggle between light and darkness that Pacquiao's supporters would have you believe, it is true that Mayweather is not exactly a gentleman hero. But in sport's spoiled, sycophantic world where no one ever tells the genius that he is out of line, that hardly makes him unusual.\n\nA floored George Foreman feels the force of Muhammad Ali after his rope-a-dope tactic in the heat of Zaire\n\nSugar Ray Leonard (right) goes toe-to-toe with Thomas Hearns in their second fight in 1989\n\nThere is a danger here, though. It lies in confusing our perceptions of Mayweather as a man with a desire to belittle his capabilities as a fighter. You might want him to lose to Pacquiao but you better accept that he probably won't. He is as close to genius as it gets in modern boxing.\n\nHe may not be The Best Ever. Debates aimed at placing that crown on one head are, essentially, specious but it is legitimate to claim that Mayweather is one of the best ever. He has fought the best fighters of his generation, Pacquiao aside, and beaten every one of them.\n\nPacquiao's trainer, Freddie Roach, said last week that Mayweather, 38, had ducked too many fighters to be considered the greatest even of this era. A cursory examination of Mayweather's record does not bear that out.\n\nHe has fought Diego Corrales, Jose Luis Castillo, Arturo Gatti, Sharmba Mitchell, Oscar de la Hoya, Ricky Hatton, Juan Manuel Marquez, Shane Mosley and Miguel Cotto and sent them all away broken.\n\nHe has won titles at five different weights. He has fought men like Victor Ortiz and Robert Guerrero, who were supposed to be new forces in boxing, but whose limitations were exposed by Mayweather's ringcraft. That is the great irony of his dominance of the sport these past few years. He is scorned as a great vulgarian, a gaudy show-off, boxing's thug king, and yet more than any other modern fighter he embodies the mastery of some of its finest skills.\n\nMayweather attacks Robert Guerrero during the his unanimous points win over his countryman\n\nMayweather floored Victor Ortiz in controversial fashion at the end of the fourth round \n\nBoxing has always venerated the artist and swooned over practitioners of the sweet science and Mayweather personifies so much of what the purists admire. He does not club his foes into submission. He does not overwhelm them with savagery. He beats them with craft and cleverness.\n\nHe is a wonderful technician in the mould of Willie Pep, Pernell 'Sweet Pea' Whitaker and Ali. The shoulder roll he uses to protect his head and body from attack is a conundrum that none of his opponents have been able to decode. He is a pugilist, not a scrapper.\n\nWhen Mayweather boxes, it is to put on an old-fashioned masterclass in the oft-neglected art of defensive combat. He makes himself devilishly hard to hit, and, slowly and steadily, picks off his opponent. His style has made fans of connoisseurs like the late, great fight trainer Eddie Futch.\n\nMayweather is not a crowd-pleaser. He is too good for that. He is so skilled that it is difficult for his opponent to land effective punches. His brand of brilliance does not make for explosive action but it does make for W after W after W on his record. He has 47 of them now to go with no defeats and no draws.\n\nMayweather has attracted criticism for his uncouth displays of his wealth on social media\n\nFreddie Roach (right) is attemtping to force Mayweather to abandon his naturally cautious style\n\nRoach says he has attended Mayweather fights where fans have fallen asleep from boredom. He is trying to goad Mayweather into abandoning his usual style because he knows it represents Pacquiao's best chance — perhaps only chance — of winning.\n\nRoach is a good man and a brilliant trainer but Money Mayweather is way too smart to fall for that. I take him to win by unanimous decision.\n\nPep's T-shirt protest is no crime, UEFA\n\nUEFA have a chance to claw back at least a little of the dignity and the credibility they have lost in recent years when their disciplinary panel meets on May 21 to consider whether to fine Bayern Munich coach Pep Guardiola.\n\nGuardiola committed the heinous sin of expressing an opinion about something more important than football at his press conference last Monday before Bayern's Champions League tie with Porto.\n\nThe punishment for that kind of deviancy is severe if precedent is anything to go by. Football's twisted world fines you more heavily for wearing branded underpants than indulging in racist chanting.\n\nGuardiola wore the top demanding justice for Jorge 'El Topo' Lopez who died in a car crash at the World Cup\n\nJorge 'El Topo' Lopez was killed when a taxi he was travelling back to his hotel in was hit by a stolen car\n\nGuardiola's crime is to have worn a T-shirt highlighting unanswered issues surrounding the death of a popular and respected Argentinian sports journalist during last year's World Cup.\n\nJorge 'Topo' Lopez, who was a friend of Lionel Messi and Atletico Madrid boss Diego Simeone, was killed in a car crash in Belo Horizonte and several details of the incident are yet to be explained.\n\nSo Guardiola did the right thing. He wore a shirt bearing the slogan #JusticiaParaTopo. And sure enough, his charge 'for an incident of a non-sporting nature' will now be judged by UEFA next month.\n\nIt is strange, isn't it, how we condemn our footballers for being one-dimensional and bemoan their lack of social conscience and say they are all spoiled little rich boys.\n\nAnd then as soon as they do something a bit different, as soon as they challenge us, as soon as they break free from the norm, UEFA come down on them like a ton of bricks.\n\nIf they have any sense left, they will dismiss the charge against Guardiola out of hand.\n\nArsenal's clash with Chelsea at the Emirates  has little relevance for this season's title race. Chelsea are too far ahead for the result to matter. But it matters for next season. \n\nArsenal, finally, are beginning to look like a team capable of fashioning a real challenge for the title again. They have improved this season despite being without three of their leading players, Jack Wilshere, Theo Walcott and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, for much of the campaign. \n\nBy winning at Manchester City and sweeping Liverpool aside, they have started to overcome psychological barriers. Beat Chelsea and another of those barriers will have been shoved out of the way.\n\nChelsea went five points clear after beating Arsenal 2-0 in October with  Eden Hazard and Diego Costa scoring\n\nArsene Wenger and Jose Mourinho face off during the last meeting between the two sides","Floyd Mayweather is brash, he can be crass, and when it comes to being a braggart, he is the undisputed World champion.

And all episodes must air in this manner before they can offer the program as an on demand option.\n\nHowever, when the third season of the prison drama premieres on Netflix on June 12, Foxtel will also begin showing the entire season in one continuous marathon, beginning at the same time.\n\nThe established prison drama is currently one of Netflix's flagship TV shows\n\nDoing this means that when the marathon is completed around 14 or so hours later, Foxtel can then upload the entire season and offer the episodes on an on-demand basis for customers.\n\nThe popular TV series is based on the book of the same name, by Piper Kerman, about a woman who is sent to prison for a crime she committed in her youth. \n\nIt's a cast that includes Taylor Schilling, Kate Mulgrew, Natasha Lyonne and Australian actress Yael Stone. \n\nThe TV series is about a woman who is sent to prison for a crime she committed in her youth\n\nThe Sydney Morning Herald reports that former MTV Australia and Foxtel presenter Ruby Rose appears in the show's third season, reportedly as a prisoner who becomes in involved with both Piper (Schilling) and Alex (Laura Prepon).  \n\nIn the US, the series is one of the major titles for Netflix there, though the organisation recently clashed with the Academy of Television Arts and Sciences, which controls the Emmy Awards, over whether the show is considered a comedy or a drama. \n\nThe upshot is that Orange is the New Black must now compete as a drama at this year's Emmy Awards, a move which means the series will compete directly against Netflix's other flagship show House of Cards. \n\nIn the US, the series is hugely popular and is one of the major titles for Netflix there",Foxtel to screen critically acclaimed us women's prison drama .

Ben Hogan did it with his one and only appearance at the Open Championship. Tiger Woods achieved it at the Home of Golf.\n\nWhen it comes to the career Grand Slam the stars align it seems, and it is completed with wondrous deeds on fitting stages. And now Rory McIlroy has the chance to join the exalted company of just five men at Augusta National, of all places.\n\nAs Woods put it: 'Where better could you ask for than to complete it here?'\n\nRory McIlroy tees off on the first during his practice round ahead of the 2015 Masters on Thursday \n\nMcIlroy is targeting his third major title and the completion of his career Grand Slam at Augusta \n\nMcIlroy (left) chats with Tiger Woods, who is ranked 111th in the world at present, at the course on Wednesday \n\nAnd so, 155 years after the first major championship, another season opens with a potentially epochal event. A campaign that will take us to uncharted territory near Seattle for the United States Open and St Andrews for The Open; to the whispering wilds of Wisconsin for the PGA. But it is here, where more majors have been held than any other venue, where we begin with the most exciting storylines of all.\n\nThis 79th Masters was set up beautifully as it was, with McIlroy's bid to win a third straight major, but Tiger's return has elevated it to another plane. Love him or not, there's no denying the frisson of added excitement he brings. Noticeably thinner and brimming with health, how good to see him walking around with a smile on his face as well and signing autographs, clearly thrilled to be showing his kids the place where he has left an indelible mark.\n\nIs this Scrooge-like conversion a sign he doesn't think he can win any more, or is he just a man whose heart has grown fonder through absence? Whatever the answer, it will make for compelling viewing over the next few days as the man who won 11 of his 14 majors ranked No 1 in the world tries to win one ranked 111th. And here's a nice little omen to send him on his way: Darren Clarke was ranked 111th when he won The Open Championship at Royal St George's in 2011.\n\nWorld No 1 McIlroy signs autographs for a host of young fans following his practice round on Wednesday \n\nIn the press room on Tuesday it was as if Rory and Tiger had switched personalities, with the former the subdued, somewhat reluctant one. To be fair to McIlroy, he's been answering the same questions for eight long months. He's talked out about the Grand Slam. Now he gets the chance to enter the blessed sanctuary that inside the ropes provides and finally seize his opportunity to set a new benchmark for European golf rather than talk about it.\n\nFor two of his four major championship victories, McIlroy got a huge helping hand from Mother Nature, as great dollops of rain rendered Congressional for the 2011 US Open and Valhalla for last year's USPGA soft and defenceless — the sort of dart-throwing contest which is right up McIlroy's alley.\n\nThis Masters might get interrupted as well by an afternoon thunderstorm or two but it is also expected to get under way on Thursday with near record temperatures for this time of year. Add that to Augusta National's sub-air system under the greens and there will be no darts thrown here. As it should be. If you're going to join legends, you should be doing it the hard way.\n\nA flock of fans capture a Woods shot on their smartphones as the American star went through his paces \n\nMcIlroy might be the bookies' favourite for good reason but his Augusta record offers up a litany of damning statistics he must rectify before he can be considered for a green jacket. Can you believe that as good a driver as the Northern Irishman is, he has hit the par five 13th fairway just four times in 22 attempts in competition? Or that he has had no birdies in 44 tries on the holes that start the front and back nines. This week we will truly get the chance to gauge his development as a golfer.\n\nAlongside him for the first two days will be Phil Mickelson, another player who had all the attributes to win Augusta at 25 but had to wait until the age of 33 to win his first Masters. It might be that McIlroy has to wait a while longer, too.\n\nThere are not only questions about his own record at Augusta that the world No 1 must answer. There's the formidable form of his peers. The next six players in the rankings — Henrik Stenson, Bubba Watson, Jordan Spieth, Jason Day, Adam Scott and Dustin Johnson — have all either won a tournament in the past two months or have a green jacket already. It is inconceivable at least one won't hit form.\n\nPhil Mickelson will play alongside McIlroy for the first two days of the tournament in Augusta \n\nThe list of potential winners stretches longer. Indeed, there's not a great golf-playing territory in the world that won't be watching with legitimate hopes of seeing one of its own triumph.\n\nNowhere will that anticipation be greater than here. A win for McIlroy and papers will be filled with where it ranks in the annals of the great feats achieved by UK sportsmen.\n\nThere's no point discussing what might be the ending when the drama has not even begun. But it's perfectly acceptable to keep fingers crossed and dare to wonder whether, over the next four days, we're going to be witnesses to a singular piece of UK sporting history.",The 79th Masters kicks off in Augusta on Thursday .

and wields - the greatest military muscle\n\nA Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman said: 'The US leader talked about China's 'sheer size and muscle', but one can also see clearly who has the biggest size and muscle in the world.\n\nOnly hours before Obama's comments, Hua Chunying added that China has 'indisputable rights' to the Spratly islands and it was 'protecting its nation's sovereignty', according to the BBC.\n\nShe said the construction was to serve troops protecting the area, civilian activity such as search and rescue operations, scientific research and commercial fishing.\n\n'The structures... do not affect, nor are they targeted at, any particular country,' she claimed before adding China would 'continue to strengthen' its activities in the area.\n\nThe US-based Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) has has been picturing and documenting the construction of an artificial island known as Mischief Reef in the South China Sea.\n\nMassive expanses of sand and concrete were being unloaded among the Spratly Islands in the disputed waters.\n\nChina used dredging vessels to dig up sediment from the sea before dumping it on submerged coral reefs to make islands, Ethan Rosen, a geopolitical researcher in China claimed.\n\nBefore-and-after images from the area show aircraft runways appearing from jungle, solid masses where there was once coral and man-made harbours replacing natural reefs.\n\nThe country claims the work is necessary to safeguard its sovereignty which it asserts over most of the South China sea.\n\nBut the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan all have overlapping claims to the region.\n\nConstruction: The US Navy initially claimed China was creating a 'great wall of sand' (pictured in February 2014) in the South China Sea\n\nControversial: A spokesperson from China's foreign ministry said the country 'indisputable rights' to the Spratly islands and it was protecting its nation's sovereignty\n\nThey claim China is illegally reclaiming the contested area and creating artificial islands with facilities that could have military use.\n\nLate last month, the U.S. Navy reported the latest land mass China had built was 1.5 square miles in size and created by dumping sand on live coral reefs, possibly damaging local ecosystems.\n\nIt was just one of several artificial islands China had been creating in the region and their exact purpose remains unknown. \n\nAnalysts claim the images circulated by CSIS reveal that China is trying to create 'facts in the water' to bolster its territorial claim.\n\nManila - one of the most vocal critics of Beijing's actions in the region - has appealed to the international community to intervene after conceding it and other countries in the region are powerless to stop China's controversial construction.\n\nIts foreign affairs spokesman Charles Jose said: 'We are asking the international community to tell China that what it is doing is wrong, and to ask China to stop this reclamation work.  \n\nChina's declared defence budget of around £97billion this year is 55 times that of the Philippines' £1.7 billion.\n\nJose believes Beijing is rushing the construction to undermine an upcoming United Nations ruling on the Philippines' claim to the territory.\n\nHe said: 'We think China has a plan and they think they have the means to do it and they can actually do it. \n\nAerial photo shows Thitu Island, part of the disputed Spartly group of islands in the South China Sea located off the coast of western Philippines, pictured on July 20, 2011\n\nOn Thursday, Obama waded into the debate by telling a town hall meeting in Jamaica that Beijing should not push around countries with which it is in dispute in the South China Sea.\n\nThe president said: 'Just because the Philippines or Vietnam are not as large as China doesn't mean that they can just be elbowed aside.'\n\nThe United States broadly supports its Asian allies against Chinese pressure and has asserted that freedom of navigation is in the country's national interest.\n\nOn Friday, Hua maintained that China has maintained 'security and peace' in the region and was working with neighbouring countries.\n\nThe commander of the U.S. Pacific Fleet warned  the constructions were 'increasing regional tensions and the potential for miscalculation' late last month.\n\nAdmiral Harry Harris Jr added: 'China is building artificial land by pumping sand on to live coral reefs - some of them submerged - and paving over them with concrete.'\n\nHarris said the region is known for its beautiful natural islands but 'China is creating a great wall of sand with dredges and bulldozers over the course of months'.\n\nThe dispute centres around hundreds of tiny shoals, reefs and islets in the South China Sea known as the Spratlys and the Paracels. \n\nSeveral south Asian countries stake claim to the territory, though China tries to control the largest portion of the archipelago. \n\nBeijing has claimed its right to the collection of land masses is 2,000 years old which, they say, includes the islands in Chinese history. \n\nTaiwan supports its claim, and has its own airfield on the island of Taiping. \n\nVietnamese officials say their government has ruled over the land since the 17th century whilst the Philippines, the closest geographically, says the islands belong to them. \n\nIn 1974, Chinese forces seized the Paracels from Vietnam, killing 70 troops. \n\nThere were further clashes between the two countries in 1988, with 60 Vietnamese soldiers killed. \n\nIn 2012 China and the Philippines were embroiled in a lengthy maritime standoff over a Scarborough Shoal. \n\nThe Filipino military employed its largest warship for the dispute over the stretch of water which they call Panatag. \n\nUpon boarding a Chinese military vessel for inspection, officials claimed they found live sharks, clams and illegal reef. \n\nLater, Vietnamese border agencies refused to stamp passports asserting Chinese sovereignty over a handful of the islands and in January it was claimed China would be taken to a UN tribunal to challenge its stake.",U.S. president implied that China was bullying its neighbouring countries.

""I saw the top of the funnel cloud, and it was absolutely massive,"" she said.\n\nShe watched the hulking gray twister grind past her town Thursday, tearing up its fringes.\n\nFarther north, in the rural Illinois hamlet of Fairdale, one person died as a twister shredded homes and ripped trees bare of leaves and most limbs. Only the thickest branches remained standing.\n\nIt was the only death reported so far in two days of tornado touchdowns.\n\nRochelle was fortunate. But in nearby Kirkland, debris was so thick on the roads, responders searching for trapped residents could not yet assess the damage or injuries, fire officials said.\n\nOn Thursday, a video surfaced on YouTube of a massive twister barreling across an open field, barely missing farmhouses and barns. Images of the funnel turned up elsewhere on social media.\n\nMultiple tornadoes ripped through the rural Midwest on Thursday. A  large and dangerous twister tore across fields in Iowa. And a twister touched down 70 miles outside of St. Louis.\n\nEight tornadoes were reported Wednesday in Oklahoma, Kansas and Missouri, the Storm Prediction Center said.\n\nBut it appears residents have been fortunate enough to come away from the terrifying weather spectacle alive. Hail stones the size of tennis balls plummeted down on Ashton, Illinois.\n\nIt could have been worse as severe tornado damage dotted a path not far from the dense populations of Chicago and Rockford -- the state's third largest city.  The tornado cut a 22-mile path through Ogle County, according to disaster management coordinator Tom Richter.\n\nNorth of Rochelle, a tornado took away a local favorite restaurant -- Grubsteakers.  ""It's kind of one of your little greasy spoon restaurants,"" said Eric Widick, who drove up in his truck to help out.\n\n""We're a community. If one person is in need, we'll all be there for them.""\n\nPeople were inside when the storm quashed Grubsteakers and turned over a semitruck parked outside. No one was killed or seriously injured,  Widick said. Although a patron who found shelter in a restroom was trapped inside for about half an hour.\n\nPeople had been eating at Grubsteakers for some 25 years and will miss it, Widick said.\n\nIn Rochelle, the tornado flattened some of Olson's friends' homes.\n\nA safe distance away from it, at her mother's house, she had to think about her husband, Chet, who was reelected mayor of the town of about 10,000 people the day before. He'd have a job ahead of him.\n\n""I have not been able to get a hold of him, Olson said, ""but I know he's in touch with the sheriff and is safe,"" she said.\n\nSheriff Brian VanVickle told journalists late Thursday that the tornado had spared life and limb in Ogle County aside from some people whose injuries were easily treatable.\n\nThe county lost 20 homes -- one of them was his own. Fifty to 100 houses had significant damage, he said.\n\nOnly foundations remained of some homes, said storm chaser Dan Gottschalk. ""You can hear the hissing everywhere from where the structures used to be,"" he said.\n\nLindsey Clark, a reporter from CNN affiliate WREX, said rescuers were pulling trapped people from a home in the Rochelle area.\n\nVanVickle was newly elected sheriff of Rochelle on Wednesday. On Thursday, the storm took his house and his sister-in-law's. ""I've got the clothes on my back,"" he said.\n\nBut his family wasn't at home when it hit. ""My family was on the way to Louisville, dog was in the basement and she survived.""\n\nIt was the first tornado the sheriff had ever seen in his county. ""I've lived here all my life, am the fifth generation in the county.  My mom said this is the first time she's ever seen a tornado.""\n\nHe is thankful that the National Weather Service warned one could come. That saved lives, he believes.\n\nThe service warned of a ""particularly dangerous situation."" People across the Midwest should be on alert for severe weather. Tornado watches were set to run out early Friday.\n\nCNN's AnneClaire Stapleton, Catherine Shoichet, Greg Botelho, Dave Alsup, Steve Almasy, Jack Maddox and Sean Morris contributed to this report.","At least one person died as a result of storms in Illinois, an official says.

Sources told DailyMail.com the students force-fed the hamster vodka and 'hot-boxed' its cage with marijuana\n\nAccording to sources connected to the incident, the party of college students force-fed the hamster vodka and 'hot-boxed' its cage with marijuana before the sickening stunt. \n\nHis stepfather John Arthur Eaves Jr, a born-again Christian who was slammed for blaming unemployment on the state's Hispanic population during his 2007 election campaign, did not respond to DailyMail.com's request for a comment last week before releasing a statement a day later.\n\nNow CEO of Eaves Law Firm in Jackson, Mississippi, Eaves Jr has unsuccessfully run for state governor and U.S. Congress. \n\nHe lost to the Republican incumbent Haley Barbour, winning 42 per cent of the vote, following controversial claims about the state's growing Latino population.\n\nHis clients today include victims of the Costa Concordia cruise boat crash. He has three sons from his first marriage, and a young daughter with Brady's mother, advertising executive Angel Eaves, in leafy Madison, MS.\n\nIn the video, his stepson Brady is surrounded by friends in beachwear who shriek with laughter as he pulls the animal from a blue cage.\n\nThe footage starts with the voice of one party-goer balking: 'Oh my f***ing God! No way!' \n\nScreaming: Eaves bellows a yell and smiles into the camera as party-goers look on open-mouthed\n\nOthers can be heard jeering: 'So good! So good!' \n\nHurling the hamster over a fence, Eaves bellows a yell as others are seen grinning and laughing behind him.\n\nThe video was uploaded to YouTube on Friday night under the name 'psycho drunk spring breaker bites head off of hamster'.\n\nWithin minutes, it was removed from the video-sharing site for violating its codes of conduct.\n\nCaching the video, animal rights group PETA launched a manhunt to track Eaves down. \n\nStephanie Bell, PETA's Cruelty Casework Director, told DailyMail.com they plan to press charges.\n\n'It is horrific,' Bell said.\n\n'Animal abuse is a community concern. People who abuse animals rarely do so only once and almost never stop there.\n\n'The link between cruelty to animals and inter-personal violence is undeniable. Many of our nation's serial killers and most school shooters share a history of animal abuse.\n\n'Often, humans and animals are abused at the same time. For example, the guy who kicks the family dog is likely abusing his spouse and children too. Cruelty to animals is always a red flag.' \n\nFirst, as the parents of Brady Eaves, let everyone please be assured that we do not take the subject of animal cruelty lightly, nor do we in any way condone the behavior displayed in the recent video of our son that has gone viral on the internet. The actions that appear in the video go against everything that our son has been taught, and we can assure everyone that his actions are not what he believes in his heart, nor are true to his character. While we are extremely disappointed and greatly disturbed by his actions, as his parents, we know Brady to be a very bright and talented young man with a huge heart.\n\nAs parents we are obviously and very seriously concerned about the well-being of our son. We have withdrawn him from school, and fully intend on professionally assessing why he behaved in such a horrible way, and what we must do as a family to keep this type of behavior from ever happening again. Raising teenagers in today's world, as most caring and loving parents realize, can challenge the best of us. We will continue to love our son with all of our hearts and be right there by his side as our family addresses this situation. We would sincerely appreciate that all parents who have gone through similar incidents with their children, and the entire community please keep us in their thoughts and prayers.\n\nThank you,\n\nJohn & Angel Eaves","Brady Eaves, 18, was filmed biting the head off a live hamster at a party.

For now remains unanswered.\n\nBut Greg Kawchuk, a professor of rehabilitation medicine, who led the study published scientific journal PLOS ONE, noted that some studies suggest it does no harm.\n\nHe said: 'Why do the same joints crack in some people and not others?' \n\nA knuckle cracks in less than 310 milliseconds and water rushing together causes a white flash\n\n'Although speculative, we wonder if being able to crack ones joints is a sign that the joint is actually healthy and that the inability to do so could be a sign of joint problems to come.'\n\nThe successful experiment confirmed the first scientific study on the topic, which was conducted in 1947, was correct by suggesting that the sound came from the formation of a gas cavity inside the joint.\n\nIt also dismissed research from 1971, which disputed the initial study and stated that the collapse of a bubble inside the joint triggered the pop.","University of Alberta research found why knuckles really crack.

There are also issues with couples never making it to India to claim their children for whatever reasons, meaning that the newborn baby is left without a parent. \n\nFor the most recent episode in the Vice series, Gianna went undercover to meet with one surrogacy agent who claimed over dinner that she could get her a Caucasian baby in two to three months - confirming that there were in fact 'extra' babies being sold on the black market.\n\nThe agent then tried to convince Gianna and her team to buy the baby that they had brought with them to the restaurant.\n\nShocking offer: One of the agents can be seen holding the baby that they brought to the restaurant with them\n\nNo morals: The agent eventually offered to sell Gianna and her team the baby over dinner \n\nGianna noted that the agent spoke with a 'shocking amount of ease' and 'talked about forging documents as if she has done it a hundred times' as she tried to sell her and her team a baby over dinner.\n\n'It made me think it wasn't a one-off thing,' she explained to Daily Mail Online. \n\nGianna never once considered buying the baby, but as a woman who would one day like to be a mother, she admitted that there was a moment when she thought about accepting the offer, knowing that she could provide the child with a loving home that it may never experience otherwise, particularly as it was made clear that the agent would have sold the baby to anybody.\n\n'When I go on these stories, I am a human being first and a journalist second,' she said of her initial reaction to the offer.\n\nThe sale of 'extra' babies on the black market was just one of the many shocking side effects of commercial surrogacy uncovered by Gianna and her team.\n\nIn the US, surrogacy can cost hopeful parents upwards of $100,000, and Gianna explained that 'the reoccurring theme' when speaking with American agents and experts about couples hiring surrogates from other countries was money.\n\nCommercial surrogacy in India costs nearly one-sixth the amount it would in the Western World.\n\n'That seems to be the main driver,' she explained, before noting that some prospective parents do choose foreign surrogacy because of the altruistic element.\n\nNo options: Many of the surrogates who spoke with Gianna said that they decided to carry a baby because they desperately needed the money \n\nDormitory: The women who agree to be surrogates at Dr Nayna Patel's Akanksha Infertility Clinic have to live at the facility until they give birth\n\nTight quarters: Two surrogates can be see sitting on the beds in their shared room \n\nAnd while American parents see the surrogacy business in India as being a 'cheap' alternative to the services offered at home, the amount of money made by a surrogate in India can vastly change her life, as well as the life of her family.  \n\nWomen can use the money to buy a home or send their own children to school, and Gianna explained that there are in fact couples who take great efforts to make sure their surrogates are a part of their lives.\n\nBut there are also countless tales of financially desperate women who are recruited in the slums and coerced into signing contracts that they can't read, only to be duped out of the money they were promised.\n\nWhen I go on these stories I am a human being first and a journalist second\n\nSurrogates undergo scheduled cesarean sections so doctors can ensure the greatest number of births per day.\n\nGianna, who witnessed the high turnover rate first hand at Dr Nayna Patel's Akanksha Infertility Clinic, in the town of Gujarat, in the west of India, was nearly speechless when she saw how rapidly newborns and their parents were whisked away following a surrogate's C-section.\n\nDr Patel maintained that the women are well taken care of and make more money than they could working 24 hours a day, seven days a week, in any other profession.\n\nAnd while Gianna explained that some women are happy that they can provide a house for their family and put their kids through school as a surrogate, the women she and her team spoke to said they chose to be surrogates because they didn't have any other options.   \n\nDuring the episode, a surrogate named Vasanti told Gianna: 'Nobody likes doing this.' \n\nDishonest: Although Dr Patel maintained that she didn't search for surrogates from the slums, Gianna met a woman who said she was working for the clinic owner as tried to recruit women from a poor area \n\nNo choice: A doctor can be seen performing a cesarean section on one of the surrogates. Surrogates have to undergo C-sections so doctors can maximize the amount of babies being born in a day \n\nToo quick: Almost immediately after this baby was born via a surrogate, the biological parents whisked the newborn away in a van as they went to return to their home country \n\nShe continued: 'I didn't have a home, so I thought I could build one by being a surrogate.'\n\nAnother surrogate named Nisha explained that she was 'helpless' and had 'no alternatives'.\n\nGianna was overcome by many of the surrogates' desperation.\n\n'It is really hard to hear someone talk about going through an experience that takes a toll on the body, that lasts longer than nine months and takes them away from their kids because they have to support their families and essentially survive,' she said.\n\nGianna recalled speaking with one surrogate's husband who recently lost his job and he confessed that he was grateful his wife had the opportunity to earn money for their family as a surrogate.\n\nHe made clear that he didn't force her into the role, but explained that it was necessary for their family's survival.\n\n'It all went back to money,' Gianna noted.\n\nAs a whole, Gianna said that she thinks some parents may be aware of the 'shadier side' of commercialized surrogacy, but a 'vast majority' have no idea this dark underbelly exits.\n\nGianna recommends that parents who are considering foreign surrogacy options should do extensive research on the agent, the doctor and the surrogate they will be working with.","Vice correspondent Gianna Toboni traveled to India to explore the country's booming gestational surrogacy industry for the HBO series.

People stopped coming to the pub, it cost me my business.'\n\nMr Thorpe launched an appeal against his conviction soon after his trial, but the case was delayed by a similar test case which went as far as the European Court of Justice.\n\nThe court ruled that having an exclusive system was a restraint of free trade and contrary to European Law.\n\nBut the landlord says the court action has seen him lose the Stoke Inn in Plymouth which he used to run\n\nMr Thorpe's appeal was further delayed until another case involving Media Protection Services Ltd, the company which took him to court on behalf of the Premier League, but which no longer does so.\n\nMr Thorpe was awarded his legal costs, which he paid privately, but he would not disclose the sum.\n\nThe European court decision in 2012 cleared a landlady of a criminal conviction, but judges left the door open for court action against publicans by ruling pubs should get permission from the copyright owner before screening matches.\n\nThe Premier League has since been taking landlords to civil courts for breaching copyright, with some ordered to pay up to £65,000 in costs.\n\nThe league sends teams of investigators to pubs around the country to try and catch those screening games illegally. Legal cases have  been brought against 250 bars and pubs during the current football season.\n\nHe said he does not know whether he can retrieve the £1,000 fine and £1,500 costs ordered by the magistrates.\n\nDespite the decision, the Premier League has insisted pubs still cannot show foreign-TV footage of its games.\n\nSince the European Court decision, it is taking landlords to civil courts and suing them using copyright laws, which were not affected by the previous ruling.\n\nIn 2012, pub Karen Murphy landlady won a landmark legal battle to overturn her conviction for using foreign decoders instead of Sky to show Premier League football matches.\n\nMs Murphy, who ran The Red, White and Blue pub in Portsmouth, Hampshire, bought games through a Greek satellite broadcaster Nova for £800 a year instead of Sky, which was then priced at £700-a-month.\n\nThe Premier League took legal action against her Mrs Murphy and she was fined £8,000 for dishonest reception of a television reception in 2006.\n\nBut a European Court of Justice ruling said having an exclusive system of TV rights was contrary to EU law and the High Court overturned her conviction.\n\nA recent investigation by trade publication, The Morning Advertiser, quoted a pub landlord saying Sky Sports cost him £16,000-a-year, compared to the £300-per-year of screening it illegally.\n\nThe decision came after Portsmouth landlady Karen Murphy won a European court battle over her conviction. Despite the ruling, the Premier League can still take pub owners to civil courts over breach of copyright",Landlord was convicted and fined for showing Albanian footage of games. But landmark European Court ruling has since ended such prosecutions. Landlord has now had convicted overturned but has since lost his pub.

I like him better.\n\n'Ronaldo did the same things wrong at Manchester United as he did when he was 17.'\n\nMeanwhile, former Holland midfielder Cocu said of Depay: 'Whether he can be as good as Arjen Robben? I think so.\n\n'They are different players, but they are both fast and have a good shot. And both always have the urge to learn.\n\n'But Memphis is only 21-years-old and only in a few years can real conclusions be drawn.'\n\nDepay's PSV team-mate Stijn Schaars is also a fan and told Helden Online: 'He's doing everything to reach the top.\n\n'He has a body of a true athlete, power and flair.

All the major British supermarkets claim they source food responsibly. \n\nAnd they have all signed up to tough rules to promote workers' rights under the global Ethical Trading Initiative, designed to protect labourers.\n\nThe revelations centre on workers in Murcia and Almeria from where millions of pounds worth of vegetables are exported to the UK every year. Workers in one field in Murcia were filmed being sprayed with pesticides.\n\nOne vegetable picker working for a firm in Almeria supplying courgettes to the UK told of the filthy conditions in which he was made to work.\n\n'For the toilet you have to go in the bushes,' he said. 'What is there to clean yourself? For these courgettes to reach England, there are workers who have suffered a lot.'\n\nGrowing trade: The workers say they have to work around dangerous pesticides - causing some to fall ill\n\nHe said workers at his company, based in Almeria, were also sprayed with pesticides but were too afraid to complain because their names would be put on a blacklist known as 'the list of rotten sardines'. \n\nLettuce: The revelations will lead to claims that the bitter supermarket price war has led to ruthless exploitation of the vulnerable\n\nThe investigation also uncovered concerns about workers for Agroherni, a Murcia firm which sells £22million worth of salad, herbs and vegetables a year to Britain's major supermarkets including Asda, Tesco, Sainsbury's, Waitrose and Marks and Spencer.\n\nIt is not alleged that Agroherni's workers are forced to live  in dirty conditions or work without sanitation, but one former employee told how she had been left in agonising pain and needed multiple operations on her sinuses after working in fields where pesticides were being sprayed.\n\nThe woman, who did not want to be named, said: 'All that matters to them is fulfilling their clients' orders.'\n\nAgroherni uses an employment agency called Integra Empleo to provide workers to pick the produce in its fields, but the workers say the agency routinely denies them pay. \n\nOne lettuce picker said: 'If we work 26 days, they write down 16 or 18. They always steal seven or eight days.'\n\nLast night Tory Richard Drax, a former member of the Environment and Rural Affairs Select Committee, said: 'If true, these allegations are appalling. It sounds like effectively slave labour producing food in 2015 which is utterly unacceptable.\n\n'Supermarkets must explain themselves. It is up to them to know who is producing their food and in what conditions.'\n\nTory Neil Parish, a colleague on the committee, said: 'There is always a price to pay for cheap imported food; whether it is poor quality, low animal welfare standards or, in this case, the appalling treatment of workers.'\n\nMore than 40 employment agencies supply labour to farm growers in the Murcia region.\n\nAll the top supermarkets say they abide by the Ethical Trading Initiative. Tesco says it has local ethical trade managers on the ground who investigate claims locally.\n\nBagged up: The revelations will horrify millions of customers of British supermarkets (file picture)\n\nBut it is thought the companies who are major suppliers to the supermarkets get round the rules by using employment agencies who cut corners to save money.\n\nBoth Agroherni and Integra Empleo deny all the allegations and say they have launched investigations into the claims.\n\nProbe: Sainsbury's (pictured) and Waitrose said they would investigate the findings immediately\n\nAgroherni said it maintains a strict procedure with regard to the use of pesticides and is not aware of any relevant incidents. \n\nIt strongly denied that it mistreats or exploits agency workers and said the fair treatment and safety of workers was paramount. \n\nHowever as a result of the Channel 4 News investigation it has ceased working with Integra Empleo and is to employ the workers directly.\n\nA Sainsbury's spokesman said: 'We expect our suppliers to adhere to the highest quality and welfare standards, regardless of where they operate in the world. We are taking these allegations very seriously and will be conducting our own investigation.'\n\nA Waitrose spokesman said: 'Worker welfare is very important to us – our supplier is investigating these allegations and will ensure that our high standards are being met.'\n\nA spokesman for the British Retail Consortium which represents all the supermarkets said: 'Ensuring workers are treated fairly in our supply chains is a key concern for retailers. We know all supermarkets will examine these allegations closely.'\n\n \n\n \n\nSorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Vegetables sold in UK are grown by workers 'denied basic hygiene facilities' in Almeria, Spain.

We had actually purchased a seat for her to sit in, and she was very happy in that and belted in correctly.\n\n'But the stewardess came up to us and said that their policy was for the child to be seated on a parent's lap. We said we were happy to go along with this and were in no way argumentative.'\n\nMr Aziz described how after being moved from her seat, his daughter became frustrated and unhappy, and it became difficult to keep her subdued. 'All we were doing was asking the cabin crew what we can do, and asking for help,' he added.\n\nAfter his daughter's behaviour continued to attract the attention of the crew, Mr Aziz claims another steward, who had not seen the original incident unfold, marched over to him 'very aggressively'.\n\nTransavia Airlines have said that the action was justified as the child was not 'following safety instructions'\n\nThe incident occurred at Ben Gurion Airport in Israel (pictured) on a flight bound for London Luton\n\nMr Aziz said: 'He was standing over me shouting and it felt like he was trying to provoke me. I felt very threatened; he was saying ""you've got to sort it,"" and that he would not help as it was not his problem.'\n\nSpeaking to  Jewish News Online, Mrs Aziz said: 'It was like a terrorist incident, I couldn't believe it. The next thing you know we're all in squad cars heading back to Ben Gurion.' Fellow passenger Ben Wasserstrum described how the pilot said that there had been 'a security breach,' before returning those on board to the terminal.\n\nA spokesman for Transavia told MailOnline: 'It is very important that flight safety instructions are followed by all our passengers. It was unfortunate that the child was ill, but even then the flight safety rules must be followed.'\n\nHowever, Mr Aziz said his daughter was not 'ill', although he admits that she was sick after she was moved. He said: 'I was covered in sick but we received no sympathy from the staff whatsoever.'\n\nHe added: 'The airline is trying to legitimise their actions and shirk responsibility. I believe that if this instance was legitimate then they'd be kicking families off planes every day because I've been on so many flights where babies don't settle. But you can't ban families from going away with babies on planes – that would be crazy.'\n\nA Chinese family was kicked off a Cathay Pacific flight last month after their three-year-old son refused to wear a seatbelt, causing a delay for other passengers.\n\nThe Hong Kong-bound plane sat at its gate at a Bangkok airport for an extra 30 minutes while the family, flight attendants and other travellers were involved in a heated stand-off.\n\nMost airlines allow children under two to sit on a parent's lap during take-off and landing. Any child over that age must sit in their own seat and wear a safety belt.\n\nThe boy's father (middle) rowed with other passengers, after the family were instructed to leave the plane after his son refused to wear a seatbelt\n\nThe boy refused to take his seat and wear a seatbelt moments before flight CX654 was scheduled to take off from Suvarnabhumi Bangkok International Airport, a passenger, named Lau, told Hong Kong's Apple Daily newspaper.\n\nAll other passengers were seated and prepared for their two-hour journey.\n\nFlight attendants asked the family to put the boy in his seat and buckle his safety belt, but the parents refused to obey their directions and insisted that the boy be allowed to sit on his mother's lap, the South China Morning Post reported.\n\nElizabeth Sedway, 51, says Alaska Airlines had her ejected from a flight because she has cancer and lacked a doctor's note clearing her to fly\n\nA married mother of two battling cancer was ejected from an Alaska Airlines flight from Hawaii to California along with her family because she lacked a doctor's note clearing her to fly.\n\nElizabeth Sedway, 51, from Granite Hill, California, posted an emotional video on her Facebook page Monday showing her family being kicked off a packed plane.\n\nMrs Sedway, who suffers from multiple myeloma - a rare form of plasma cancer - detailed her ordeal in a status update accompanying the short video, which has been shared nearly 10,000 times as of Tuesday evening.\n\nIn the message, the mother of two explained that she was sitting in the handicapped section of a boarding area at Lihue Airport on Kauai when an Alaska Airlines representative noticed she had put on a surgical mask to shield herself from germs and came up to her asking if she needed anything.\n\nMrs Sedway initially said she was fine, but when the airline employee approached her a second time, she indicated that she might require a little extra time to board the plane because she sometimes felt 'weak.'\n\nDaniel Levitan was barred from an American Airlines flight after his family advised a tannoy announcement saying he had a nut allergy\n\nThe Sedway family eventually boarded the plane and were awaiting takeoff in their seats when an airline representative came on board and announced that the cancer-stricken passenger could not fly without a note from her doctor.\n\nA  schoolboy with a peanut allergy was barred from boarding a U.S. plane after his parents asked for a tannoy announcement advising fellow fliers not to eat nuts.\n\nThe parents of Daniel Levitan are appalled at their alleged treatment by American Airlines, adding a staff member had told them previously: 'Americans have the right to eat nuts'.\n\nDaniel, 11, was at the gate at Florida's Fort Myers airport when his parents demanded the announcement - but an American Airlines staff member refused, they said.\n\nIn the ensuing row, Daniel's parents explained his throat could have closed in a 'worst case scenario', which prompted them to be barred altogether.\n\nThe AA staff member then allegedly demanded to see a 'fit to fly' certificate before sending the family away and cancelling their tickets.","Sarina Aziz was flying back from Israel with parents Mark and ariella Aziz.

and walks past lifelong friends in the street.\n\nThe mother-of-two suffers from prosopagnosia, also known as face blindness, which means she is able to recognise objects, but not faces.\n\nThe condition is so severe that Mrs Whitear can't spot her own reflection  or her children when picking them up from school.\n\nNatalie Whitear, 35, cannot recognise herself in the mirror as she suffers from prosopagnosia, also known as face blindness\n\nThe condition is so severe that Mrs Whitear can't recognise her husband Garrick, 39, or children Mia, eight (left) and Eva, three (right)\n\nAlthough she was born with the condition, she was only formally diagnosed around three years ago.\n\nMrs Whitear, from Fareham, Hampshire, said: 'If you asked me to explain what someone looked like I wouldn't be able to do it.\n\n'I tend to smile at everyone just in case I bump into someone I should recognise.\n\n'I can describe the weight, height, and hair colour of my husband and children, but not their facial features in detail - I remember when my daughter was born I'd try to memorise her features but it was impossible.\n\n'I love to paint but I've never been able to draw my husband's face, I always leave it blank.\n\nShe continued: 'I was once in a restaurant and for the entire meal I thought the place was twice the size - it was only when I stood up that I realised I'd been sitting in front of a mirror - I had no idea because I didn't realise that all the faces were the same.\n\n'I recognise people by the way that they walk, what they're wearing, or their voices.'\n\nProsopagnosia is a neurological disorder characterised by the inability to recognise people's faces.\n\nAlso known as 'face-blindness', the severity of the condition depends on the degree of impairment a person suffers.\n\nSome people with prosopagnosia may only struggle to recognise a familiar face, while others will be unable to discriminate between unknown faces, and in more severe cases sufferers cannot distinguish a face as being different from an object.\n\nSome sufferers are unable to recognise their own faces.\n\nThe condition is not related to memory loss, impaired vision or learning disabilities.\n\nIt is thought to be the result of abnormalities, damage, or impairment in the right fusiform gyrus - a fold in the brain that appears to coordinate facial perception and memory.\n\nProsopagnosia can result from stroke, traumatic brain injury, or some neurodegenerative diseases.\n\nIn some cases the condition is congenital, and present at birth.\n\nIt appears to run in families, which makes it likely to be the result of a genetic mutation or deletion.\n\nSome degree of prosopagnosia is often found in children with autism and Asperger's Syndrome.\n\nTreatment of the condition focuses on helping sufferers develop compensatory strategies, including relying on voice recognition, clothing, or unique physical attributes.\n\nSource: National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke\n\nMrs Whitear, mother to daughters Mia, eight, and Eva, three, first became aware of her condition when her boss noticed she was unable to remember people she'd met before.\n\nShe said: 'About two or three years ago my boss took me to one side and told me I needed to be more careful with remembering people's names.\n\n'He said that he'd seen me introduce myself to people I'd known for years, and asking who they were.\n\n'I explained to him that I could remember their names, but not their faces - it was only because of his shocked reaction that I suddenly realised that this was not normal.\n\n'I found a test on the internet that asked you to recognise celebrities' faces and I failed.\n\n'I was then contacted by a psychologist at Bournemouth University who diagnosed me with prosopagnosia, and suddenly everything made sense.'\n\nLooking back, Mrs Whitear realises that the condition has affected her throughout her life.\n\nShe said: 'When I look back, there have always been signs of the condition but I never even realised.\n\n'I never had posters of famous people on my bedroom wall because I didn't know what they looked like.\n\n'People would say that they'd stood next to me at a queue in the supermarket but I'd ignored them, or I'd walked past friends in the street.\n\n'I've also always been a nightmare when it comes to watching TV - we watch a lot of box sets but I will get continuously lost and ask over and over who each of the characters is.\n\n'It's even worse on a period drama where they are all wearing similar clothes.'\n\nMrs Whitear uses various coping mechanisms to ensure that her face blindness does not affect her daily life.\n\nShe said: 'I recognise people by what they're wearing, how they style their hair, or the way they walk.\n\n'The people close to me all look very distinctive - it must have been a subconscious choice.\n\n'My husband is 6ft 4in tall, one of my best friends is Chinese and the other has very long hair, so they're easy to pick out in a crowd.\n\nMrs Whitear can describe the weight, height, and hair colour of her husband and children, but not their facial features\n\nOnce Mrs Whitear's eldest daughter Mia (left) wore her hair pigtails so she didn't recognise her. Another time she did not recognise her daughters when picking them up from school\n\n'But if someone is wearing something different, or out of context, I won't be able to spot them.\n\n'My eldest daughter almost always wears her hair in one long plait, but one morning my mother had dropped her off to school and put her in pigtails - when I came to collect her in the afternoon I didn't know which child she was.\n\n'When Mia was younger she had a full head of brown curly hair, as did one of her friends, so when they were toddlers it was very easy to get them mixed up.\n\n'While I can't describe what my family look like, I know the way that they make me feel.\n\n'When I met my husband, I wasn't attracted to the way he looks, because I didn't know, but I was attracted to the way I felt when I was with him.\n\nMrs Whitear said: 'While I can't describe what my family look like, I know the way that they make me feel'\n\n'If we go to the cinema together and I go off to the toilet or to get a drink halfway through the film, when I come back into the screening, I'll always count the seats back to him, rather than look for his face.'\n\nIn an attempt to remember faces, Mrs Whitear uses Facebook, and takes lots of pictures of family and friends.\n\nShe said: 'I use my friends list as a personal database of all of the people I know, in the hope that I can recognise them when I see them in person.\n\n'I take as many pictures as possible to try and remember my children's expressions.\n\n'I know that the condition is unusual, but I use these various coping mechanisms and I never let it bother me - I've never known any different.'\n\nDr Sarah Bate, from the Centre for Face Processing Disorders at Bournemouth University, has carried out research into prosopagnosia.\n\nShe said: 'It  is a cognitive condition characterised by an impairment in face recognition.\n\n'Very rarely some people acquire the condition following neurological trauma, but we've recently become aware that many more people have a developmental form of prosopagnosia.\n\n'These people have never suffered any neurological damage, and appear to have simply failed to develop the visual mechanisms that are required for face processing.\n\n'Sometimes the condition appears to run in families, and often people report other first-degree relatives who also appear to be poor with faces.\n\n'Recent estimates suggest as many as two per cent of the population (that's one in 50 people) have a degree of face blindness, yet public awareness of the condition remains low.'","Natalie Whitear, 35, suffers from prosopagnosia: facial blindness. Rare condition means she is unable to recognise faces, even her own . She confuses her  daughters and walks past lifelong friends in the street.

You could have had me. You could have had an apartment, a car, a driver. But instead you throw all that away for some f****** hippie!' \n\nMadoff was arrested in December 2008 after he confessed his multi-billion dollar fraud to his two  sons and they reported him to the FBI.\n\nHe pleaded guilty to 11 federal felonies in March 2009.\n\nThe charges included securities fraud, wire fraud, mail fraud, money laundering, making false statements, perjury, theft from an employee benefit plan and making false filings with the SEC.\n\nMark Madoff killed himself on the second anniversary of his father's prison sentence. \n\nAndrew Madoff, who had been head of equities at his father's New York based company, died last year after a battle with lymphoma, and had previously blamed the stress caused by his father for his relapse. \n\nMadoff (left) is pictured with his wife Ruth and his son Mark, who killed himself after his father's arrest \n\nAndrew Madoff, on the Today show with fiance Catherine Hooper, left, and mother Ruth Madoff, right, said he would never forgive his father - not even on his death bed\n\nEarlier this year 76-year-old Madoff wrote a letter from prison saying the pain he inflicted on victims of his Ponzi scheme is nothing compared to having to deal with losing both his sons. \n\nDefrauded Madoff investors have long viewed the convicted swindler's sons, wife and other family member suspiciously, arguing it is impossible that they did not know about his lies.\n\nBut they were never criminally charged - and never forgave him.\n\nThe allegations about Madoff's advances towards his dealer's girlfriend are contained in Rogers' book The Ganja Godfather.","Bernie Madoff is serving 150 years in prison for $65billion Ponzi style fraud.

He had been United's best player during the Tyne-Wear derby defeat at Sunderland in the previous game and was surprised by his omission, which was explained as a tactical switch to pair Jack Colback and Mehdi Abeid in midfield.\n\nWhat followed was a training-ground disagreement with Carver and Gutierrez tweeted on Thursday, 'I am tired about some things. I am Geordie. Newcastle deserves more'. \n\nMeanwhile, a source added: 'They are treating him very badly. He does not deserve this. He just wants to play for Newcastle.' Gutierrez's contract is up in the summer and he will be let go after seven years at the club. The clause which meant he would be guaranteed an extension after eight starts this season cannot now be activated.\n\nHowever, Sportsmail also understands that Gutierrez trained with the first-team on Monday and will be in the squad for Saturday's visit of Swansea with both Carver and the player keen to move on from their dispute.\n\nThe midfielder has long since been critical of his treatment by the Magpies after they told him to find a new club when he returned to Tyneside having beaten the cancer for the first time in November, 2013.\n\nNewcastle midfielder was given a heartfelt ovation when he appeared as a substitute at Anfield\n\nGutierrez was eventually loaned out to Norwich City for the remainder of the season. The cancer, however, returned last summer and he underwent a course of chemotherapy in Argentina. He returned to Newcastle in December and has made five appearances, the last of which came as a second-half substitute at Anfield when he was given a heartfelt ovation by the home fans.\n\nAnd, in an interview last month, Gutierrez spoke of his disappointment at the manner in which Newcastle had handled his illness.\n\n'I won't be able to forgive the way I've been treated, no,' he said. \n\nGutierrez will not be offered a new deal by Newcastle despite seven years at the club\n\n'I don't think it was the right time nor the circumstances and I think at times like that, you should look after the individual, the player.\n\n'I returned mid-November (2013) and in December the manager said I should find myself another club, that it was best. I understand a lot of things about football that for the directors it is a business, no? 'It is clear that they look after the club's interests, but I think in a situation like that, you need to consider other things, even more as I had been playing for five years before having this problem. I was always playing.\n\n'And I never asked for anything.

Picnic perfection.\n\nThe adjacent islet of Dasia comprises little more than rocks jutting out of the blue sea, but our appetite for maritime adventures was well rewarded here. Watching the whiskered faces of two monk seals rolling lazily in the sea was unforgettable.\n\nThese shy, endangered marine mammals - once widespread around the Mediterranean and beyond - are now limited to small ranges, one of which is close to Skopelos.\n\nGlossa is a smaller town in the north, and its white-washed houses are as authentic as you might wish, with few compromises to mass tourism.\n\nWe spent an enjoyable evening here before reaching one of the stars of the island, Agnanti, a restaurant perched high on a hilltop.\n\nOwner Nikos offers visitors fine traditional seafood as well as slow-cooked pork, and the terrace has some of the most spectacular views on the island.\n\nWe were tempted to exclaim: 'Mamma mia!'\n\nInstead, we wondered how quickly we could return to this gorgeous island.

She's been battling leukemia since 2012 and has missed several days of school because of the recovery process\n\nWhen Rose found out that she had been kicked out of the school, she tearfully said that she 'didn't do anything wrong'. The 7th-grader is in remission but still recovering from acute lymphoblastic leukemia treatments, which started in 2012\n\n'It sounds like they're not going to pass her anyway, even if she goes back,' Barbara McGrath said of her 7th-grade daughter, who is in remission but still recovering from treatments for acute lymphoblastic leukemia diagnosed in 2012. 'I don't see her being able to go back there and being successful.'\n\nThe school wrote in a letter addressed to Rose's father that officials worked with her but absences 'hampered her academic performance.'\n\nIt adds that the 12-year-old had attended 32 full days this academic year out of 134 days as of April 13, but Barbara McGrath says that doesn't include 'numerous' partial days.\n\nThe school, which charges as much as $6,983 per year for tuition, also wrote that it has taken 'significant adjustments to our standards' to help Rose, including reducing her workload and paring down assignments and tests.\n\n'Rose's attendance, coupled with her academic performance, do not qualify her for continued attendance at St. Joseph Middle School,' the letter read.\n\nIt continued: 'We know Rose to be an intelligent and thoughtful child, and believe she would be well-suited to enroll in an academic setting more geared to homebound students, perhaps an online program as we have discussed in the past.'\n\nThough Rose is done with her treatment she still feels ill and has trouble attending her classes and finishing her schoolwork\n\nRose's mother says her daughter isn't skipping out of school 'to have fun' but that she has to miss school because she doesn't feel well\n\nBattle Creek Area Catholic Schools' pastor administrator John Fleckenstein was not immediately available for a comment. \n\nHe told WWMT last week that 'these were extraordinary circumstances' but they were necessary after 'so many accommodations were made' to help Rose.\n\nBarbara McGrath countered that the school made only minor modifications to the workload and her daughter 'had to do every single project, every single test.' McGrath added that, by her account, Rose was on track to pass this year.\n\n'I didn't do anything wrong, but they still got rid of me,' Rose McGrath said tearfully last week to WWMT.\n\nBarbara McGrath said that though Rose is finished with her treatments, she has a long way to go.\n\nJohn Fleckenstein, Battle Creek Area Catholic Schools' pastor administrator, claims that the school made many accommodations for Rose and that none of them seemed to help her enough\n\nRose attended St Joseph Middle School in Battle Creek from kindergarten through 7th grade. Though she's been offered a spot back at the school after they dismissed her, Rose's mother said 'it sounds like they're not going to pass her anyway, even if she goes back'\n\n'Even though she's now done with her treatments you still have a very long recovery process because you've basically just put two and a half years of poison into your body. You're not recovering overnight,' she said..\n\nRose told WWMT that school was the one place that she actually felt normal.\n\n'When I'm at home, I'm sick, I don't feel well; no one else does that. But when I'm at school I'm like everyone else,' Rose said.\n\n''The accommodations which were made were woefully inadequate for a child with such a serious diagnosis,' said Rose's father Tom McGrath to WWMT.\n\n'It's not like she's out at the mall having fun, she's in her bed, sick with nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain. She's not having fun, she's sick. She'd be at school if she could,' Barbara said.\n\nBarbara McGrath said they have filed a complaint with the federal Office of Civil Rights and asked the private district to adopt an accommodation plan for ill students similar to those required in public schools.\n\nRose appears to have had a large support system throughout her treatment. She told one news source that school was the only place she felt normal\n\nSt Joseph claims that Rose, pictured here raising money for St. Baldrcks to find a cure for childhood cancer, only attended 32 full days this academic year out of 134 days as of April 13. Though St Joseph as invited her back, she is now attending a public middle school in the Battle Creek area","St. Joseph Middle School in Battle Creek, Michigan, had dismissed Rose mcgrath for low attendance and poor academic performance.

But having a budget shop nearby means your house could sell for less\n\nIn a study published today, Lloyds Bank investigated average house prices in postal districts that have chain supermarkets nearby, to see how they compared to the wider postal region.\n\nHouses in areas with a Waitrose cost an average of £354,378 – which was £38,831 (12 per cent) more than typical prices for their regions.\n\nSainsbury's also delivered a big boost to residents, as properties near the store were worth 10 per cent more (£24,506) than ones in the surrounding area that weren't near a branch. \n\nThe price of having a supermarket on your doorstep: Waitrose scores highest - and Aldi the lowest\n\nTesco came in next, with a price premium of 8 per cent (£17,125), followed by Marks & Spencer, on 7 per cent (£18,786).\n\nBut the presence of an Aldi nearby was associated with house prices that were 3 per cent (£5,910) lower compared to the wider postal region.

The process is expected to take 15 to 30 minutes at most\n\nTexas Department of Criminal Justice officials said a recent purchase of pentobarbital means they have enough of the sedative to carry out Sprouse's execution and three others set for this month. \n\nThe state's supply will need to be replenished for at least three other executions that are scheduled in May and June.\n\nDeath penalty states have found it increasingly difficult to acquire drugs as manufacturers, bowing to pressure from death penalty opponents, refuse to sell to state prison agencies for use in capital punishment.","Kent Sprouse, 42, faces lethal injection at 6pm Thursday.

You are doing more harm to the mujahideen than good. Fear Allah.' \n\nSome of the rules, particularly regarding the publishing information on the location of fighters and the use of tactics, appears to come after a series of calamitous social media errors by some fighters.  \n\nIslamic State fighter Mark Taylor, originally from New Zealand, shot to fame after accidentally tweeting his location whilst fighting in Syria.\n\nTaylor forgot to turn off the geo-locator setting on his account, allowing intelligence services to successfully track his every movement.

One of the British terror twins, Zahra Halane, has previously broken the rules by announcing the death of her husband on social media.\n\nKnown as Ali Al-Farsi, 19-year-old Ali Kalantar's death was first tweeted by Halane, under the nom de guerre, Umm Jafar al-Britaniyah. Halane quickly deleted the tweets but not before a screenshot had sent them viral. \n\nIslamic State propaganda remains highly important to their strategy for recruitment and legitimacy.

He had insulted Frazier before their first fight and did so again chanting: 'It will be Killa and a Thrilla and a Chilla when I get The Gorilla in Manila.' Thus the title for the fight, The Thrilla in Manila, was coined.\n\nAli pictured alongside his infamously big-spending wife Mrs Belinda Ali in September 1975 \n\nFrazier, the quiet man, was plotting a strategy of breaking down Ali with shots to the stomach, ribs, kidneys and liver, quoting the old ring maxim: 'If you kill the body, the head will die.'\n\nAli would target the Frazier head and won the early rounds while his legs were at their freshest.\n\nBut it was impossible for him to keep dancing in the pressure-cooker heat, with the ring temperature reaching 120 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nAs Muhammad started slowing, Joe began Smokin'.

Although the monstrous barrage which sent Frazier reeling and staggering could not put him down, it was enough to bring a sensational end to an epic battle.\n\nAli ordered his corner-man Herbert Muhammad to cut off his gloves, saying he could not go on. But before he could do so Frazier's trainer Eddie Futch called a halt. A relieved Ali famously said: 'This is the closest to death I have ever been.'\n\nFrazier begged to be allowed to see out the 15th and final round but Futch told him: 'It's over.

Once a customer states they intend to move, the firm is not allowed to impose an exit fee or apply the new higher tariff even if the move takes place after the date of the increase.\n\nHowever, industry regulator Ofgem found that E.on broke the rules by hitting tens of thousands of departing customers with a higher tariff in the days before their account was switched. \n\nThe firm admitted the mistake as far as customers who paid by direct debit or cheque were concerned. However, it failed to notify Ofgem that it also affected people with meters until late in the investigation.\n\nIt has refunded £8 to £12 to 40,000 customers who paid by cash or cheque and is now trying to find another 7,000 meter customers to pay them an average of £3.42. While the sums involved are relatively low, Ofgem imposed a high penalty because E.on did the same thing in January 2012.\n\nAt that time, it was ordered to refund £1.4million to customers and pay £300,000 in lieu of a penalty to Age UK. \n\nThe firm claimed it had implemented new procedures to stop it happening again, but was guilty of the same mistake in both 2013 and 2014.\n\n'Absolutely unacceptable': Regulator Ofgem said the penalty reflected E.ON's 'repeated failings' on billing rules after the company incorrectly imposed exit fees and overcharged customers\n\nOfgem's enforcement chief, Sarah Harrison, said: 'Our rules give customers a chance to avoid exit fees and higher costs when suppliers put up prices. These are important customer protections and it is vital suppliers play by the rules.\n\nThe energy regulator has imposed fines on energy companies totalling £168 million since 2010.\n\nBritain's Big Six energy suppliers are responsible for £99million of the payments, with British Gas the worst offender among them with their figure totalling £34.6million.\n\nE.ON has been fined £24.8million in total. The payments are as follows:\n\nNovember 2012: E.ON agrees to pay out £1.7million to customers and charities after customers were incorrectly charged exit fees or overcharged following price rises.\n\nJuly 2013: The company agrees a £3million package of fines and money for customers after it misreported the number of energy-saving light bulbs it had distributed under an energy efficiency scheme.\n\nMay 2014: E.ON agrees to pay £12million to vulnerable customers for mis-selling.\n\nApril 2015: The company agrees to pay £7.75million to Citizens Advice to help vulnerable customers in addition to £400,000 already paid to those affected, after it was found to have overcharged in the wake of price rises. \n\n'It is important that E.on has repaid potentially affected customers and co-operated with the investigation. \n\nHowever it's absolutely unacceptable that it failed to provide these vital customer protections yet again and this persistent failure is the reason for the high penalty.'\n\nCitizens Advice chief executive Gillian Guy said the ruling should send a warning to other firms. 'Consumer rights cannot be ignored,' she said.\n\n'Customers shouldn't be trapped in higher bills.

It was an exciting fight and there is a genuine rivalry with them, it's not done for show.\n\n'I think the next one will be electric.'\n\nThe current plan for the 25-year-old pair to meet in the autumn is a risky one as six months is a very long time in boxing. Although unlikely, either man could lose on May 9 before Saunders will face undoubtedly the biggest challenge of his career against the winner of Lee-Quillin.\n\nSaunders got the better of Eubank over 12 rounds when the pair met back in November\n\nEubank and Saunders are both keen on a re-match and while May 9 is a possibility an autumn fight is more realistic  \n\nDefeat for Saunders or Eubank before the rematch could damage the credibility of the fight and Warren knows it could be in everybody's best interest to get the fight on as quickly as possible.\n\nHe added: 'It is a long road to the rematch and that is why when I leave here I will be sharpening my pencil and having a look at [doing the deal]. Billy has said what he wants and now we will see where we get to.'\n\nEubank won the WBA interim world title by out-pointing Dmitry Chudinov at the 02 Arena in February and the Brighton man has urged Saunders to forget about his current route to the WBO title and instead concentrate on dethroning him.\n\nBut Saunders taunted his rival by saying the belt does not mean anything.\n\nSaunders said: 'That's not a world title. Do you call that a world title yeah? Well you're mad then. You're deluded man, you must be on drugs.\n\n'Take your little belt home and hold your trousers up with it because that is all it's good for.

'I did not beat it by that much. There was a bit of banter and he is trying to beat me now.'\n\nBellerin shaved a hundredth of a second off Walcott's time, prompting the 26-year-old winger to vow to reclaim his title at the end of the season. \n\nAnd since then he has gone on to establish himself as a right-back of some promise, progressing well beyond Arsene Wenger's expectations.  \n\n'I am happy that now, after not so good performances in the beginning, the coach has still put confidence in me and given me minutes. \n\nBellerin has exceptional pace, as he proved in August when he set a new Arsenal record over 40 metres\n\nTheo Walcott had previously held the record, but Bellerin shaved one hundredth of a second off his time\n\nBut Walcott is determined to take his record back from Bellerin this summer and be speed king again\n\n'The chances always come through injuries, which is not a nice thing. Now we are going to have Debuchy back and I am happy for him, but when you get your chance, you need to do the best you can. I have done my best to take this opportunity.'\n\nWith Debuchy on the verge of match fitness, Bellerin will soon find out whether he has done enough to grab that opportunity. \n\nBut after his brilliant goal at the Emirates stadium last weekend, one thing is for certain - he is no longer known just for being quick over 40 metres.",Hector Bellerin broke Theo Walcott's Arsenal sprint record last summer. Arsenal defender Bellerin says the result has caused 'a bit of banter' . The Arsenal youngster has impressed at right back this season. Return of Mathieu Debuchy leaves Arsene Wenger a decision to make.

The male judge said, 'What young man would not jump on that candy?'\n\n'One is a recognition that it does not matter who the perpetrator is or what the circumstances are. A teacher has absolutely no business engaging in sexual contact with a student,' Anderson said. \n\n'The second is a shift in the culture where boys and their parents are feeling empowered to come forward to say that something has been done.' \n\nIn recent weeks, a Stamford, Connecticut high school English teacher, Danielle Watkins, 32, whose case was prosecuted by a female state's attorney, was sentenced to up to 10 years in prison for having sex with an underage male student. \n\nIn Michigan, a female judge sentenced Kathryn Ronk, 30, a Spanish teacher at Bishop Foley High School in Madison Heights, to up to 15 years in prison for having a sexual relationship with a 15-year-old boy, saying 'the law does not recognize a double standard.' \n\nIn New Jersey, a female prosecutor said the most lenient plea deal she would offer Nicole Dufault, 35, a Columbia High School English teacher accused of sexual relationships with six teenage boys, was 15 years in prison. \n\nThere are contrary examples, such as Pennsylvania's Erica Ann Ginnetti, 35, the Lower Moreland High School math teacher who had sex with a 17-year-old student and was sentenced to 30 days in jail by a male judge who said, 'What young man would not jump on that candy?' \n\nThat was after a female prosecutor reportedly said in court that the victim's senior year became a nightmare, his grades plunged and he still struggles with social interactions. \n\nBut the Twitter furor ignited by the April SNL skit in which a male judge fist-bumps a boy who had sex with his 'hot' teacher indicates how attitudes are changing. \n\n'Appalled by the #SNL sketch glorifying sexual abuse of a male student by female teacher. Sends the worst message &minimizes real experiences,' tweeted Heather Timmis @hnt108. \n\nAn SNL spokesperson declined to comment. \n\nThere is no central U.S. reporting system for tracking female teachers who prey on male students, according to federal education officials, but Abbott has been charting the crimes from news coverage. \n\nHis research showed that female teachers far more often than male teachers use social media to lure students, creating an electronic 'paper trail' that may aid prosecutions. \n\nSchool districts are increasingly moving to ban private social media contact between teachers and students, sometimes in an effort to prevent inappropriate relationships. \n\n'Social media enables the behavior to start,' Abbott said. \n\n'There is no way that a teacher is going to walk up to a kid in the hallway and say, ""Hey, would you like to see a naked picture of me?"" They won't do it. But they will do that on social media. It's like it erases what used to be that barrier.'","According to the U.S. department of Education, female teachers who sexually assaulted students often got a pass in the past. Attitudes have now changed and more are being prosecuted   . In U.S. schools last year, almost 800 School employees were prosecuted for sexual assault - nearly a third of them women.

Must every interview be a license for a journalist to ask anything he'd like?\n\nFrom the start of the 7-minute television interview, it seems evident that Downey is not particularly interested in being there, even if being there was, ultimately, a benefit to him -- after all, he's promoting his latest film, ""Avengers: Age of Ultron."" He grows increasingly agitated, even as the line of questioning remains on-topic; his attitude, meanwhile, grew increasingly smug.\n\nHis eyes glaze over as the reporter talks, he makes condescending comments and gestures that seem intended to intimidate and imply he's much smarter than Guru-Murthy, and he repeatedly looks toward his handler as if to say, ""Do I really have to sit here with this guy?"" At one point, he makes fun of Guru-Murthy for seeming nervous, saying, ""Your foot is starting to jump a little bit. You better get to your next question.""\n\nBut it's after Guru-Murthy asks Downey whether he thinks he is ""free from all of that,"" referring to Downey's history of ""taking drugs, drinking"" that the building tension comes to a head. ""I'm sorry,"" says Downey, ""What are we doing?"" To which Guru-Murthy replies, ""I'm just asking questions,"" which indeed was so.\n\nDowney has the right to refuse to answer the question, of course, but that's not what he does next. Instead, he throws the celebrity interview equivalent of a tantrum: He smiles arrogantly, says ""bye!"" and stands up to leave.\n\nHe sure showed him!\n\nIt's true that we live in a culture where we feel we have the right to know everything about celebrities -- who they're dating, what they're eating, where they vacation, what they meant when they made that comment 10 years ago. Journalists often go too far, even if it's their job. And certainly not every journalist is good at his job.\n\nBut while Downey may be understandably tired of answering questions about his past, questions that have been asked before, his business is our business. The entertainment industry is about entertaining people. As such, we tend to like to watch actors who seem like they want to be watched. This is why most celebrities, especially those with a big budget movie to promote, agree to interviews and seek out recognition in general. But when the recognition no longer serves them? Then they want to bemoan it?\n\nWhat Downey seemed to misunderstand is that the interview format gives journalists the right to ask questions. That's what an interview is. He certainly can decline to answer questions he does not feel are appropriate, or even ones he simply doesn't feel like answering. But he does not have the right to be absolved for behavior that is rude, demeaning, and disrespectful -- even if he's a celebrity, and even if he felt uncomfortable or put-off.\n\nWhat the video shows is a movie star with a bullying streak. After he removes his microphone and his handlers begin hustling him out with kid gloves, the actor cannot resist a parting shot. He turns to the reporter, being sure to look directly at the camera on the way, and says, ""You seem okay. It's just getting a little Diane Sawyer in here,"" followed by what sounds like, ""and you're kind of a schmuck.""\n\nDowney might not have been ""in the mood"" to be questioned... and those days, those moods, are understandable. We all have them. And yet in this case, that's, well, too bad. The actor has agreed to an interview as part of his job. He has agreed to engage in a conversation with another professional human being. Given the terms, he is not entitled to call all the shots.\n\nThat he thinks he can is perhaps our own, celebrity-obsessed doing -- we revere the famous; is it any surprise when they reveal that they, too, regard themselves as better than everyone else?\n\nBut it's still on him.","Peggy drexler: in interview To promote movie, robert Downey Jr. walked out after being asked personal questions.

Except that is not his intention.\n\nQuite the opposite, in fact. The Carlisle manager loves a job that over the years has seen him break and rebuild a toilet, man a hose and pay salaries from his own pocket. 'It's the life I want for myself,' he said. 'It gets me out of bed.'\n\nBut there is no escaping the fact that Curle is in a shrinking minority, being one of only four managers in the country's top 92 clubs who has played for England. The drain of leading English players to television rather than management was the key finding of a Sportsmail study. It seems that talking about the game is more appealing to former players than a life orchestrating it — easier money, less time and pressure. Many ex-players simply have no financial need to work but for Curle, money has only ever been just a part of it.\n\nKeith Curle insists football management was always his priority after ending his playing career\n\nCurle has taken charge of Carlisle after learning his trade in the lower league backwaters\n\n'Football was all I had and all I wanted,' he said. 'As for ex-internationals, I guess there will be fewer going to management now because of the money they earn. You'd think they don't need a wage but some will have only a passion for football.\n\n'That might mean being in front of a camera. I have done a bit for Sky and I really enjoyed it but first and foremost I am a coach and manager. That's how it is for some managers – it's what you are.\n\n'But if you are like that you have to like a challenge.'\n\nFew are better placed to illustrate the challenge of management than Curle. He won three England caps but has spent most of the past 13 years in places where TV rights do not sell for billions.\n\nHe started at Mansfield and went on to Chester, Torquay and Notts County before joining League Two Carlisle United last September after nearly five years coaching Crystal Palace and QPR under Neil Warnock.\n\nCurle (right) is one of only four former England players to currently manage in the football league\n\nThe well-travelled defender played for a total of 10 clubs during his career, including Manchester City\n\nCurle claims to have caught the management bug after playing for Wolves under Colin Lee and John Ward\n\nThe 51-year-old's days are long and his experiences would not seem such fond memories to everyone.\n\n'At Chester, I drove around looking for places to train,' Curle said.\n\n'Elsewhere, I've raised money to pay bills for training facilities that haven't been paid for. You are also lending people money for wages that have not been paid.\n\n'At Mansfield, we had a toilet in the middle of the changing room so I helped knock it down and rehouse it.'\n\nIt was at Mansfield that Curle used a fireman's hose to water the training pitch.\n\n'You do everything you can,' he added. 'You get your hands dirty.\n\n'It's hard. Most days I'll be in my office at 8.15am and I'll usually leave at 5.15pm. Not bad. Then I'm often in the car to go and watch a game.\n\n'Sometimes you'll go to three in a week. Being in Carlisle that's a lot of time in the car, getting home after midnight.'\n\nIt's all part of the puzzle of turning thoughts into performances and performances into results. That's what keeps managers like Curle hooked.\n\nCurle started his management career at Mansfield where he missed out on promotion to Division Two\n\nCurle returned to former club Torquay as manager but could not save them from relegation in 2007\n\nCurle tooks Notts County on a run of 22 consecutive away games without defeat before being sacked\n\n'Winning matches is what I love,' Curle said. 'I got a bug for coaching when I was playing at Wolves (in the late 1990s) under Colin Lee and John Ward.\n\n'I wanted to understand why we were doing something.\n\n'John started showing me his coaching journals that he had kept for years, logging every session. All my coaching sessions now are logged.\n\n'The development plans I have for every player now are also logged. I am plotting their development on my own graphs, watching how they reach targets.\n\n'There is nothing better than improving a player and seeing it on the Saturday.'\n\nThe 51-year-old spent five years working as a coach under Neil Warnock at Crystal Palace and then QPR\n\nCurle believes there is no better feeling than developing a player to reach their targets\n\nAnd nothing worse than getting the sack. It has already happened to Curle and will probably happen again.\n\n'The overall challenge is to build a team but that takes 18 months,' he said.\n\n'How often do you get 18 months in a job? Summer is best — you talk about philosophies and there is no pressure. Then the season starts and you need results. It's a challenge, a good challenge.'\n\nAnd obviously it's not for everyone. For others, it's a peculiar part of the charm.","Keith Curle is one of only four England players to currently manage.

Investigators emphasized in February that they want to figure out why this one did, becoming the deadliest accident in the 32-year history of one of the nation's busiest commuter railroads.\n\nInvestigators looked for any elements that may have intensified the fire, which they believe was ignited by the SUV's gas tank.\n\nThe NTSB has examined such factors as the adequacy of emergency exits, the train cars and the unusual design of the Metro-North line's third rail.\n\nThere is no barrier at the crossing between the street and the tracks where the crash occurred. \n\nMTA is considering all possible safety enhancements that would prevent deadly accidents in the future, the company's chairman said.","Ellen Brody, a mother-of-three was killed along with five rail passengers in February in the horrific crash in Valhalla, New York.

Abu Ayman al-Iraqi (right), a former colonel in Iraqi Air Force intelligence now plays a leading role in ISIS' military council\n\nHaji Bakr list specific information the 'spies' would be required to obtain, including; 'lists of the most powerful families, their source of income, size of rebel brigades and their leaders' and potential illegal activities and information which could be used for blackmail in the future.\n\nHaji Bakr also outlines that men loyal to ISIS would be selected to marry the daughters of the most influential families, in order to 'ensure penetration of these families without their knowledge,' Der Spiegel writes.\n\nAnother document charts a command structure for an internal intelligence organisation, outlining who would spy on who 'in case they don't do their jobs well.' \n\nOne former Syrian rebel who became an ISIS regional commander told the Washington Post that he found that almost all of the highly secretive officials overseeing all aspects to the terror group's day-to-day business were ex members of Hussein's Baathist army. \n\nAs well as their extensive military expertise, another key element of the commanders' appointments has been the fact the ex-Baathists have extensive contacts among oil smugglers thanks to Hussein's efforts to avoid international sanctions in the 1990s.\n\nCrucially, oil smuggling is considered the most lucrative aspect of ISIS' £2 billion-a-year income. \n\nInfluence: Despite thousands of foreign fighters flocking to join the Sunni extremist group and starring in their propaganda videos, ISIS' leadership is dominated by ex-members of the military of Saddam Hussein (pictured)\n\nPast: The process of giving former Iraqi commanders senior roles was started by Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi's predecessor Abu Omar al-Baghdadi (left) who was a former Iraqi Army officer and therefore more trusted than the Jordanian criminal, former gangster and ex-alcoholic who founded ISIS, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi (right)\n\nThe former Iraqi Army generals' connections with oil smugglers are crucial to ISIS' £2 billion-a-year income\n\nMiddle East analysts and experts believe one key reason why so many former Iraqi army commanders have joined ISIS is due to the de-Baathification law brought in L.­ Paul Bremer - the American who served as temporary head of the Iraqi state following the ousting of Hussein.\n\nThe law effectively meant that 400,000 members of the defeated Iraqi army could no longer be employed in government roles and were barred from drawing their military pensions. \n\nMany of these highly-trained commanders joined the insurgency in the country in the mid-2000s, which was dominated by ISIS who at the time were known by the name Al Qaeda in Iraq.\n\nWhen al-Baghdadi took control of the group in 2010, many of these commanders were given prominent leadership roles in the hope they might win the support of the Sunni tribes who dominate Western Iraq and who have been largely ignored by the country's Shia-led Baghdad government.\n\nThe process had, however been started by al-Baghdadi's predecessor Abu Omar al-Baghdadi who was himself a former Iraqi Army officer and therefore more trusted by the military than the Jordanian criminal, former gangster and ex-alcoholic who founded ISIS, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi.\n\nOne of the most prominent former Iraqi Army generals within ISIS was Fadel Ahmad Abdullah al-Hiyali, who used the code name Abu Muslim al-Turkmani, and was in charge of all the terrorists' operations in Iraq until he was killed in an American airstrike last November.\n\nHe had previously been a colonel in military intelligence and served in Hussein's Republican Guard.\n\nOther senior figures include Abu Ali al-Anbari, who currently acts as Baghdadi's deputy leader in Syria and is a former military general in Hussein's Iraqi Army, and Abu Ayman al-Iraqi, a former colonel in Iraqi Air Force intelligence and now plays a leading role in ISIS' military council.\n\nLess prominent militants with an Iraqi Army backgrounds include Abu Ahmad al-Alwani - a former Baathist soldier and now an ISIS military council member, Abu Kassem - a former Iraqi officer and now in charge of ISIS suicide bombers and foreign fighters.",German magazine uncover 'blueprints for Islamic State' in Syria.

The truth is that a dark, cold night at Preston North End in mid-February is more significant.\n\nUnited were poor that night in the FA Cup at Deepdale, coming from behind to win.\n\nThat, however, was the night Wayne Rooney was restored to a centre-forward position, the night Louis van Gaal finally began to realise the best place from which his best player and captain should lead was from the front.\n\nManchester United captain Wayne Rooney has been returned to his preferred position up front\n\nThe 29-year-old had previously been deployed in midfield this season and United had struggled \n\nNow, manager Louis van Gaal (left) looks set to unleash an in-form Rooney on Manchester City on Sunday\n\nUnited actually lost their next game at Swansea but have subsequently won their next five in the league, with Rooney scoring four times. Incredibly, given the pattern of this season, they head into Sunday's derby game with Manchester City as slight favourites.\n\nPrior to that night in Lancashire, Rooney was on the verge of knocking on his manager's door to ask for an explanation about his deployment in the centre of midfield. It seemed as though Van Gaal was about to experience his first very real problem at Old Trafford.\n\nWhether he sniffed something in the air, we will never know. But Van Gaal performed a sharp volte face at just the right time and Rooney has gone on to become the most significant figure in United's return to relevance.\n\nAt Old Trafford, just as he has since Cristiano Ronaldo left for Real Madrid almost six years ago, Rooney represents the most serious threat to City's prospects.\n\nPrior to the win over Tottenham, Rooney stood before his team-mates in Manchester's Lowry Hotel and delivered an impassioned call to arms. He is once more the central figure at his club, in more ways than one.\n\n'I think some people mix up scoring goals with form,' said Van Gaal yesterday. 'For us Wayne is very important as a player, as a captain and because he can score goals. But he can do that from midfield, too. The last goal he scored — against Aston Villa — came when he was playing in midfield.'\n\nVan Gaal's mid-season deployment of Rooney in midfield remains a sensitive subject. No coach likes to admit he may have been wrong. All that matters now, though, is the 29-year-old's current trajectory, which is undoubtedly upwards.\n\nHis name is written right through recent derby history of course. He is the fixture's record goalscorer and the scorer of one of its most spectacular goals, that remarkable overhead kick back in 2011 that some City supporters, rather oddly, still maintain came off his shin.\n\nPreviously there had been the transfer saga of autumn 2010.\n\nCourted heavily by City as he prevaricated over a new United contract, Rooney most definitely had his head turned. To this day, rumours persist of meetings in an underground car park at the Etihad Stadium — that one has always seemed a little fanciful — and promises of a salary in excess of £300,000 per week.\n\nRooney scores his side's second goal during United's 3-1 Premier League victory over Aston Villa \n\nWhat we do know is that there was a point when City and their manager Roberto Mancini thought the transfer was about to happen.

There is no evidence that they actually work, the council claimed, and yet it is a multibillion dollar business.\n\nHomeopathy is a medical philosophy that essentially believes your body is the best weapon to fight disease.

More than 130 people using another homeopathic medicine with zinc, Zicam, reported to the FDA that they lost their sense of smell. The FDA issued a warning to consumers about it in 2009.\n\nThere is a misconception that all homeopathic products are ""natural"" according to the FDA ""and therefore safe. Unfortunately, FDA has become aware of significant safety issues associated with homeopathic products in recent years,"" according to an email from the agency.\n\nOther issues include a 2010 FDA warning about Hyland's Teething Tablets. They also recalled the tablets that had inconsistent amounts of belladonna. Larger doses of the substance can be toxic.\n\nIn 2014, the FDA warned consumers about Pleo Homeopathic drug products having penicillin or derivatives of penicillin.\n\nAnother expert asking for stricter standards with homeopathic medicine, Janine Jagger with the Familial Mediterranean Fever Foundation, said that there should be stricter label standards that better explained what was actually in the homeopathic product. She believed there was a ""deceptive illusion of treatment"" when people chose these homeopathic options over pharmaceuticals that have been proven to work.\n\nA third of Americans use alternative medicine\n\nA mother and editor of an alternative medicine magazine and website, Peggy O'Mara, testified that homeopathic medicine has helped her family over the years.\n\nAs a writer and editor of health publications, she said she has seen a growing interest in this kind of medicine, and she believes it is is well-placed. She believes people have more trust that consumers do their research before purchasing the product, as she does.\n\nShe wishes doctors were better versed in this kind of medicine and believes others want ""safe, effective and easily accessible"" products that are ""nontoxic"" alternatives to help people feel better.\n\nThe public hearing will continue Tuesday. The FDA could make decisions about these labeling and regulation standards some time this year.",The FDA may take a more hands-on approach to regulating Homeopathic medicine. It does not go through the same approval process as over-the-counter drugs. Some studies suggest Homeopathic medicine is no more effective than placebos.,['The summary conveys the main idea of the article though it misses describing the size of the industry being $2.9B as about one third of Americans uses some sort of alternative medicine.'],0.6971710851131677,1.0,0.6443386405624972,0.9999999999999999,0.696353414637341,0.2779450237863005,0.0,0.7292940851021275,0.27005549684276264,0.0,0.6686158827916754,0.5580228301640726,0.5250503445954688,0.6098707713341263,0.1364241437255008,0.11256549059139045,0.3923099596591897,0.11355379481754599,0.09729048702870913,0.3454664118738609,0.0982591010037952,0.08519380202536257,0.31685609072555465

None paid enough.\n\n'The student loan didn't cover even my housing, let alone living expenses, food, books and travel costs.'\n\nShe added that money worries meant she began to struggle academically as well as financially.  \n\n'I had trouble keeping up with course work, especially if I worked evenings.\n\n'For example at the pub, I'd earn £7 an hour for an eight hour shift, two nights a week, so I'd bring home about £100 weekly.\n\n'I'd just moved to London from the north of England. My family are not well off, so cannot afford to help me much.\n\nThe student says that traditional means of earning failed to cover the cost of living in London \n\n'I didn't know anyone in London so when I moved here it was starting from scratch.'\n\nInitially she lived in student accommodation in the city but says that working as a prostitute enabled her to afford somewhere better.\n\n'It was an overcrowded, noisy flat with other students,' she said of her halls.\n\nShe moved into her own home after she began to advertise her services.\n\n'I could afford a place of my own. I advertise through a website and have regular clients. \n\n'I visit them at home, in hotels and occasionally at their workplace.'\n\nDespite sex work not being an ideal situation the student says that it had been beneficial towards her studies.  \n\n'It is flexible and fits around my course.\n\n'I can work the hours I want to and scale back around exam time or if I have extra course work.'\n\nThe woman heard about sex work from other students who had also been looking for a way to earn extra money. \n\n'In my first year at university I started hearing about students turning to sex work,' she said. 'After a time I met someone on another course who'd been working as a stripper in a bar.\n\n'Through her I met another student doing escorting, she clued me in, said where to advertise, and how to avoid bad clients and work safely.\n\n'She gave me the English Collective of Prostitutes' Rights sheet which tells about the laws and how they work. \n\nAlthough her new means of earning have enabled her to continue studying in London the woman says she does not particularly enjoy her work.\n\n'My biggest worry is about being arrested because if I get a criminal record it would stay with me for life. It would be massive obstacle to getting other jobs.'\n\nHowever she remains adamant that this is the best option for her after seeing other friends trying alternative routes.  \n\n'Sex work is far batter paid and suits my time more than any other work I know of.\n\n'Friends at university are working 10 hour shifts for under the minimum wage. Others are working on zero hour contracts and never know how many hours they will get.\n\n'Sometimes they get none at all so it is very hard to budget and pay bills.\n\n'I know students who've dropped out and left courses due to financial pressures.'\n\nHowever she is well aware of the risks she is taking and says she takes appropriate precautions to avoid being found out.  \n\n'Mostly students doing sex work don't talk about it. If it comes out, it could affect your future and job prospects.'\n\nThe student's story may seem like a rare case but she says that it is become more regular practice in universities: 'Since I started escorting I've heard that a former roommate exchanged sex with her landlord to cover the rent.\n\n'Another woman I know worked as a part time sex worker to earn enough to travel home to visit her family.\n\n'Sex work among students is much more common than people think, and it is likely to increase as long as fees, rent and the cost of living is so high.'",A student has revealed she turned to sex work to cover the cost of living and studying in London. She tried regular work but still struggled to pay the bills. She says that sex work is becoming common practice among students  .,['•great summary with elaborate detail. \u2028'],1.0,1.0,1.0,0.9999999999999999,0.2613919410810626,0.6951745175604965,0.18624489738773367,0.6882814035506142,0.33085344948393525,0.0,0.5872804675631532,0.4336635103384838,0.4244680415024451,0.4816797890402764,0.1568878302814747,0.12872208664858206,0.8549647099219613,0.12276536727492149,0.1047924911607617,0.40391896040110503,0.18675478667918216,0.15943666948872331,0.7517725514291027

But local people claim housing bosses are trying to perpetuate a false image of the area, by giving it a makeover before the programme is aired.  \n\nResidents have slammed the face lift saying the estate - owned by local housing group Thirteen Group - will look 'completely different' to anyone who visits after watching the show.  \n\n'It's normally quite a grotty street. The front gardens were filled with all sorts of rubbish. One house had a balcony with a sofa on it.\n\n'There were bikes just lying in the street left there by children,' said Mike Swift, who lives nearby. \n\nThe housing association said the works had been planned well in advance and were nothing to do with the programme\n\nA young resident is filmed by Channel 4 as part of the show.

It's almost as if they know they're going to get people coming and looking.\n\n'They were annoyed when it came out Channel 4 were filming there, worried it was portrayed as a bad area.'\n\nStockton-on-Tees Council and Thirteen Group have denied the works were planned with the release of Benefits Street in mind. \n\nA spokesman for the local authority said it had been scheduled in advance, adding the council had done 'everything' to thwart the controversial series being filmed in Stockton.\n\n'We did everything in our power to persuade the producers of Benefits Street to turn their attentions  elsewhere. Sadly, you can't win them all.\n\n'Lots of people agreed with us that this is not a good thing for the Borough.'   \n\nA spokesperson for Thirteen Group who own the houses and are in charge of the developments said: 'The ongoing investment in our properties is planned well in advance and any inference that the filming of any TV programme could influence this is completely untrue.' \n\nAmong the residents who took part last year was White Dee\n\nUpon the launch of Channel 4's Benefits Street, the nation was split in two. \n\nMany considered the programme an insightful glimpse into some of life's struggles and encompassing of some of Britain's biggest problems. \n\nOthers criticised producers for, they said, making objects of their subjects.

There, Mr Justice Edis ruled the driver had unlawfully imprisoned Mr Hicks, who was therefore entitled to damages.\n\nThe exact amount of compensation is yet to be decided - but is set to be around 50 per cent of what the family had requested and thought to be 'hundreds of thousands of pounds'.\n\nSpeaking on behalf of the family, lawyer James Davies said: 'This was a terrible incident in which Kristopher suffered a very severe brain injury leaving him needing care for the rest of his life.\n\n'The latest judgement agrees that Kristopher is entitled to a settlement to provide specialist rehabilitation and care which will help maximise his progress.'\n\nMr Hicks, who was 23 at the time of the incident, had gotten into the taxi with his girlfriend Abigail Noad at Orange Grove taxi rank in Bath to his home in the Foxhill area, according to high court documents.\n\nIn a police interview, Mr Young said he had become suspicious after hearing Ms Noad joke that the couple were not going to 'do a runner'.\n\nDeciding the issue of liability, the judge said Mr Young mistakenly decided Mr Hicks was not going to pay the fare on November 2 in 2010, adding there was no basis for him to think so.\n\nThe driver had decided to take Mr Hicks back to the rank to cause him as much inconvenience as possible. \n\nMr Hicks, who found himself being unlawfully driven off by a stranger into the night, decided he should try to escape.\n\nMr Justice Edis said: 'The end result is that the claimant decided to jump out of the taxi at a dangerous speed. I do not know why he did this.\n\n'It may have been that he misjudged the speed and thought it was safe to do so, but the true motive will never be known.'\n\nHe said had Mr Hicks jumped out when it was stationary at lights there would be no permanent damage.\n\nMr Hicks had gotten into the taxi at the Orange Grove rank in Bath (pictured) in 2010 with his girlfriend\n\n'I have broadly accepted the evidence of the defendant and therefore find that his intention was not to do anything other than to return him to the rank where he would be released,' he added.\n\n'This is the kind of conduct which creates a significant risk to life and limb as this case demonstrates.'\n\nThe judge said it was a 'stark and unattractive choice' to decide between the two - and concluded there should be a 50 per cent reduction in the damages payable to Mr Hicks.\n\nHe was also entitled to a further £250 for unlawful imprisonment.\n\nLawyers representing Mr Hicks said the incident left him with 'devastating' brain injuries and he is now being cared for by his mother Gill.\n\nSpeaking at the time the claim was lodged with the High Court, James Davies, said: 'Whilst he has undergone extensive treatment and rehabilitation, he has developed post-traumatic epilepsy, headaches, fatigue, suffers social and behavioural problems and has no sense of taste or smell.\n\n'He is reliant on 24-hour care from his mum and is unable to work.'\n\nBoth sides were given permission to appeal and a further hearing will determine the amount which Mr Young will have to pay.","Driver Michael Young, 56, thought passenger was planning to 'do a runner' so he decided to take passenger Kristopher Hicks him back to the taxi rank.

I think I know the location of $20million worth of stolen art - I hope you have WhatsApp.'\n\nIt's a line that wouldn't sound out of place in a heist movie.\n\nBut that was the anonymous call that helped art sleuth Christopher Marinello, 53, track down nine paintings including works by Chagall and Rivera stolen from an LA mansion.\n\n'I got this tip-off from a shadowy figure in Slovenia called Darko,' said the London-based founder of Art Recovery International.\n\nScroll down for video \n\nArt detective Christopher Marinello has tracked down £250million worth of stolen art including this 1920 Henri Matisse painting Le Jardin\n\n'He sent me images of the paintings via WhatsApp and we set up a sting operation with the LAPD and recovered nine of paintings which were stolen in broad daylight six years ago.'\n\nThe art detective is no stranger to high profile cases – having been central to the recovery of a £1billion Nazi-looted hoard found in a squalid Munich flat in 2012.\n\nHe currently represents the heirs of renowned art dealer Paul Rosenberg in their bid to recover Henri Matisse's 1921 Femme Assise.\n\nIt was discovered amongst other priceless works in a flat owned by Cornelius Gurlitt, the son of Nazi art dealer Hildebrand, and has been valued at around £60million.\n\nHe is representing the heirs of art dealer Paul Rosenberg in their bid to recover Henri Matisse's 1921 Femme Assise (left) which was found in a squalid Munich apartment along with this Marc Chagall painting (right)\n\n'The painting was found covered by a layer of grime. There was a milky white film on it as it had been sitting flat, unstretched amongst rotting food,' said Mr Marinello.\n\n'It didn't even have a frame, but there is no doubt that it is the original Matisse. It has been tested by a number of experts and the Rosenberg family has an incredibly detailed archive.\n\n'It should clean up nicely and we were able to determine it has not been directly touched since Matisse completed it.'\n\nThe reclusive eccentric died in May last year and left the collection dubbed the 'greatest find of the post-war era' to Kunstmuseum Bern.\n\nThe museum announced that it would accept the immense trove of art amassed by a Nazi-era art dealer, but would ensure any looted art was returned to the rightful owners.\n\nAnd just yesterday it emerged that Germany has signed an agreement to return Matisse's Femme Assise to the Rosenberg heirs. \n\nIn the past two decades, Mr Marinello has tracked down £250million worth of stolen art including priceless works by Picasso, Renoir and Matisse.\n\nThe founder of Art Recovery International examines evidence relating to Matisse's Le Jardin with head curator Lars Bystrom\n\nHe tracked down nine paintings including Les Paysans by Marc Chagall (pictured) stolen from an LA mansion\n\nOne of his most recent cases saw him recover El Greco's 1944 'Portrait of a Gentleman', which was seized from Julius Priester's collection by the Gestapo in Vienna. \n\nMr Priester, a prominent art collector, had fled to Paris with his wife Camilla six years before, when Austria was annexed into Germany as part of the Anschluss in 1938.\n\nLast month Mr Marinello also tracked down two sculptures which were stolen with weeks of each other from Hirschl and Adler Gallery in New York 32 years ago.\n\nPaul Manship's 'Central Figure of Day' was taken during an exhibition in December 1983 and just three weeks later 'Figure of Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney' by Prince Paul Troubetzkoy disappeared from the same show.\n\nAnother of his most high-profile successes was the recovery of Matisse's Le Jardin after it was stolen from the Museum of Modern Art in Stockholm by a burglar armed with a sledgehammer.\n\nMore than 1,400 artworks were found in a squalid Munich flat owned by Cornelius Gurlitt, the son of Nazi art dealer Hildebrand\n\nCriminals are both nemeses and friends to the detective and if you spot him sitting in a Starbucks, the chances are he's about to sit down with an art thief.\n\n'I've met with a criminal who's been holding onto some very valuable artwork for over 30 years several times at a cafe in Paris,' said Mr Marinello.\n\n'I often receive and exchange stolen works in pubs and cafes. In fact if you see me sitting alone in a Starbucks, there is a high likelihood I'm not just having a cup of coffee. I prefer meeting in public places, as it can get interesting.\n\n'I deal with criminals if I have the permission of the authorities. If the theft happened 25 years ago, the police aren't as interested and in those cases I'm given permission to handle the case myself.'\n\nBefore he became the public face of the company, he used to work undercover and once set up a sting operation to catch a man trying to illegally obtain a Van Gogh picture worth £2million.\n\nHe has also recovered a multi-million pound Devo painting from the middle of the street in Manhattan from a celebrity who unwittingly came into possession of the stolen artwork.\n\n'I was meeting a well-known celebrity at the corner of a street in New York and suddenly a beige Mercedes Benz pulled up and the window rolled down. Out came a Devo painting rolled up in a tube inside a black plastic bag.\n\n'That is definitely one of the more unusual places I have exchanged artwork.'\n\nFinding the missing art in the first place is a major undertaking as Mr Marinello and his team often locate stolen works before law enforcement.\n\nTo do this, they have developed Art Claim, the world's most technologically advanced database for stolen, looted and missing works of art, antiquity and cultural property.\n\nOnce a missing artwork is entered into the database, they use image recognition software to scour catalogues at Sotheby's, Bonham's, eBay and other auction sites until they find a match.\n\n'It all starts with Art Claim. Anyone who has a theft whether it's a museum or holocaust victim should report the theft, then we search art fairs, online sellers, and auction catalogues.\n\n'There is a huge risk in buying a stolen work as the legal fees can be back breaking. The publicity alone can be hugely damaging to a high net-worth collector.\n\n'People spend hundreds of thousands and do absolutely nothing to check the provenance. You need to know in advance what you're buying.'\n\nMr Marinello believes art theft is on the rise and said it is now the third highest-grossing criminal trade, behind guns and drugs.\n\nCornelius Gurlitt's father Hildebrand (right), was commissioned to obtain artworks on behalf of Adolf Hitler (left) and bought works confiscated from Jewish families\n\n'It is worse than ever. The economic downturn over the past few years, security cuts at museums and wars have all contributed to the fact that cultural property theft is on the rise.'\n\nBut Hollywood-style art heists with James Bond-style equipment and elaborate getaways are not the only way that priceless works disappear.\n\n'Art is stolen in every way imaginable, but it is not always a well thought-out endeavor.\n\n'Some thieves just see a work and think 'I can just put this in my bag and get out of here'.\n\n'What they don't realise is that these works are not at all easy to sell on. Once an artwork is on our database - as this one is - we will be searching art markets all over the world for it.\n\n'Art can also be lost in transport and there is also insider theft. Of course there are also movie-style elaborate break-ins. Methods are getting creative, but we are trying to stay one step ahead.'\n\n'Thieves are always going to be thieves. Art thieves are common thugs. There's no romance there. The same people who'd steal your wallet would steal artwork.\n\n'The Internet has made it easier track but it's easier for the criminals as well.'","Christopher Marinello has tracked down £250million worth of stolen Art.

All peachy skin and thick, glossy locks, she also looks trim and toned in skinny jeans.\n\nIt's difficult to believe that in the next few months, the actress – remembered by many as the glacially beautiful half of ITV's 1980s detective duo Dempsey And Makepeace – will be collecting her bus pass. From where I'm sitting, she looks barely a day over 40.\n\nIt is impossible, frankly, not to wonder whether Mother Nature has been given a, shall we say, little helping hand. There is no 'pillow face' here or unnaturally shaped eyebrows (a telltale sign). So has she and would she?\n\nScroll down for video \n\nThen and now: Tearing up the rulebook: Glynis Barber, pictured left in 1984, and right, the actress today\n\nGlynis Barber, pictured at The Olivier Awards at The Royal Opera House in London last week\n\nIt's a question that Glynis answers diplomatically. 'I am a bit surgery-phobic – I am a total coward,' she insists. 'I don't judge anyone for doing it – people have to do what's right for them. But for me a healthy lifestyle is the key.'\n\nIt's hard to argue with that sentiment. And this, indeed, is why we are meeting. For the past two years, under the tutelage of nutritional therapist Fleur Borrelli, Glynis has changed what and how she eats – and in the process, she says, transformed her health and her figure.\n\nShe tore up her rulebook too: out went breakfast – instead she has just two large meals a day. Out, too, went wholegrains and she even stopped sipping water in the day, something she once swore by to stay hydrated and stave off hunger.\n\nSo convinced is she that what Fleur taught her is the key to long-lasting health and wellbeing that she has co-written a book with her, The In-Sync Diet, in which she shares their discoveries, backed up, she says, by credible new research.\n\n'I had no idea that when I met Fleur I would drop a stone in weight and a dress size, gain lean muscle, and have vastly improved energy levels, all while turning upside down the things I previously believed in,' Glynis says. 'But that's what has happened and it's why I wanted to share it with a wider audience.'\n\nThe actress (pictured with co-star Michael Brandon) is remembered by many as the glacially beautiful half of ITV's 1980s detective duo Dempsey And Makepeace\n\nIronically, Glynis once thought herself the last person to need a lifestyle reboot. Always fit, she went organic in her late 20s at a time when it was barely heard of. 'This was the 1980s so everyone thought I was mad, although it made complete sense to me,' she recalls. 'My view was it was silly to put chemicals in your body that don't need to be there, but that was forward-thinking at the time. It was me, Prince Charles and some hippies. But I stuck to it.'\n\nGlynis, married to her Dempsey And Makepeace co-star Michael Brandon, has enjoyed a busy career in theatre and TV, but two years ago started to develop unexplained joint pain and was advised by her osteopath to see Fleur. 'I was actually pretty resistant at first as I thought the one thing I know is how to eat properly,' she explains. But Fleur thought differently. 'One by one she busted a lot of the myths that were a cornerstone of my diet.'\n\nFirst to face scrutiny was Glynis's fondness for wholegrains. 'I was surprised as I knew about processed grains but I thought wholewheat was fine, until Fleur explained that it creates inflammation in the gut. She told me to cut them out.'\n\nAging well: Glynis, pictured left in her 30s, will be celebrate turning 60 soon, but she looks barely a day over 40\n\nIt meant a gluten-free diet – not easy for a self-confessed 'breadaholic'. Pasta was also jettisoned, replaced by protein and vegetables. 'At first I thought, ""I can't do this,"" ' she explains. 'But now I don't miss them at all. I eat salmon, eggs, nuts, organic turkey and salads.'\n\nAnd it was not just what she ate but when that Fleur also changed. Glynis ate little and often in the belief it kept her blood sugar levels regulated. But Fleur told her that cutting out breakfast altogether and eating two large meals a day was a better way of regulating her metabolism.\n\nThis is backed up by new research into intermittent fasting, which shows that better weight control can be achieved with long periods without eating – popularised by the 5:2 diets, in which you consume very few calories for two days of the week and eat a normal, balanced diet the rest of the time. Some studies have found the same benefits – which also include lower cholesterol and blood pressure – might be gained by daily 'fasts' achieved by eating dinner then nothing else until lunch the next day.\n\nThen came what Glynis drank. 'I was one of those people who walked around clutching a water bottle and sipping at it throughout the day,' she says. 'But new research shows that drinking little and often actually doesn't help the cells replenish properly. It's far better to drink a large glass of water when you're thirsty.'\n\nGlynis tore up her rulebook too: out went breakfast and she even stopped sipping water in the day, something she once swore by to stay hydrated and stave off hunger\n\nInitially cynical, Glynis says she was amazed by how easy it was to adapt. 'What I was trying to overturn were the habits of a lifetime and I thought it would be incredibly hard, but it honestly took a matter of weeks. It's not set in stone either. If I want the odd blowout, or I really fancy breakfast, then I have it.'\n\nAided by her regular cardio and hot yoga sessions, she believes she is in better shape than she was 20 years ago. 'I have always been fit but I used to get incredibly tired. Now I am bursting with energy.'\n\nAnd, Glynis insists, she is less likely to scrutinise herself. 'I actually feel less vain now than I did in my youth. I'm very comfortable in my skin and I'm really not hung up on age at all. You can't do anything about your chronological age, but how you age is up to you.'\n\nThe In-Sync Diet, by Glynis Barber and Fleur Borrelli, is published by Autharium on Friday.\n\nThe actress follows a gluten-free diet, with food like pasta jettisoned, replaced by protein and vegetables\n\nWhy hydration is key\n\nBy Barney Calman, Health Editor \n\nWe should all drink at least two litres of water a day – about eight glasses. If we do, we'll be slimmer, have better skin, fewer health problems and the like. Right? Well, no, actually.\n\nThe whole two-litres-a-day idea is based on no real scientific evidence. In fact, one of the only studies to suggest its benefits was sponsored by, you've guessed it, a mineral water firm.\n\nDehydration can be fatal, and in the case of the elderly, sick children or those with other health problems, a watchful eye should be kept on water intake.\n\nBut in normal, healthy adults, the body is well adapted to make sure this doesn't happen. If you drink too little, you get thirsty, and go to the loo less. If you drink a lot, you generally pee it all out.\n\nAnd in fact, the best way to make sure is to check the colour of your urine. Ideally, it should be a shade of pale straw and no darker.","Glynis Barber is known as beautiful half of itv's 1980s detective duo.

Check. Five o'clock shadow across a lantern jaw. Check. A hint of fresh sweat? Check. \n\nThe current crop of male leads smouldering all over our television screens are rocking a 'pretty but gritty' look that makes Colin Firth's erstwhile Mr Darcy look positively hygienic.\n\nShows such as Poldark, Vikings, Outlander and Game of Thrones are dressing up their key actors in breeches, leather and chain metal and asking them to get down and dirty for their art, much to the delight of watching female fans.\n\nBattle of the breeches! Actor Kit Harington (left), clad in leather, plays Jon Snow in the hit HBO fantasy series Game of Thrones \n\nAnd the dimly-lit period setting - think candlelight and flaming torches - only serves to accentuate the mean and moody looks.\n\nAidan Turner is leading the way as Captain Ross Poldark in the BBC's much talked-about Sunday night offering. So enthralled are the viewing public by the Irish actor's good looks and rippling physique - which he shows off in plenty of topless scenes - that several Twitter handles have been dedicated to parts of Poldark's anatomy.\n\nOngoing HBO success,  Game of Thrones has caused a similar loin-stirring frenzy among those watching with characters such as Jon Snow and Jaime Lannister perfecting the tender but rugged look.\n\nTime travel drama, Outlander, based on the books by Diana Gabaldon, flings main character Claire Randall into the arms of 18th century Highland warrior Jamie Fraser, played by Sam Heughan. The handsome Scotsman admits he has found the ensuing attention overwhelming.\n\nAnd flying the flag for Nordic hunks is Travis Fimmel, who stars in the show Vikings, which charts the tumultuous rise of Viking king Ragnar Lothbrok. With his shaved hair, beard and quiff, Fimmel could be mistaken for a London hipster were he not pretending to be a Norse seafarer. \n\nSo who are the actors behind this new breed of slightly grubby yet thoroughly enticing sex symbol? And do they ever wash their hair? We dig a little deeper below:\n\nScroll down for video \n\nStubble and swashbuckling: 2015 is all about the unkempt hunk. Leading the way is 'Poldark and handsome' Aidan Turner\n\nPOLDARK  \n\nAidan Turner continues to get the nation's ladies a little breathless in his role as Captain Ross Poldark for the BBC.\n\nThe star, pretty much an unknown before the hit show, has been catapulted into the spotlight with his 'Poldark and handsome' appeal responsible for soaring viewing figures. \n\nIrishman Aidan has stoked the fires somewhat himself by offering up some of the BBC beauty secrets that have transformed him into Winston Graham's hero. \n\nAiden admitted to using baby oil to show off his well-honed pecs and even a slick of eyeliner to make his deep brown eyes stand out. Although the actor won't be drawn on his chest hair, his man rug does appear to have been pruned... ensuring Poldark is pretty but still gritty. \n\nThe other Jon Snow: With his wild locks and leather outfits, actor Kit Harington has stolen hearts in Game of Thrones, pictured above with co-star Rose Leslie\n\nHot metal: Danish actor Nikolaj Coster-Waldau played wild-man Jaime Lannister  in Game of Thrones\n\nGAME OF THRONES\n\nActors Kit Harington and Nikolaj Coster-Waldau have brought this  medieval fantasy epic to a whole new audience with their wild man antics.\n\nNot entirely dissimilar to Aidan Turner in looks, Kit Harington plays Jon Snow (no, not the tie-sporting Channel 4 news presenter)   in the HBO fantastical series and matches a smattering of stubble with dark curls and puppy dog eyes. \n\nThe star has admitted to having a 'baby face underneath all of this fuzz' and that he has to stay away from the shampoo for the role, sometimes for as long as up to six weeks.\n\nDescribing his less-than-attentive hair regime, he told GQ magazine last year: 'I like it to look greasy and medieval.' \n\nHe admits his locks get 'very tangled' and by the end of a six-week shoot, they look 'pretty horrible.'\n\nCo-star Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, who plays bearded brute Jaime Lannister, has something of the Sean Bean in Lady Chatterley's Lover about him. \n\nUntil series four when Jamie lost his right hand, his character was known as the best sword fighter in the world, cue lots of swashbuckling and rolling around in mud... all usually by torchlight. \n\nThe disheveled, combative image may have been toned down a little but fans continue to trip off his every word...all of which seem to be spoken in perfect English, despite the fact that Coster-Waldau is Danish.\n\nTartan has never looked so good: Sam Heughan plays Scottish warrior Jamie Fraser in Outlander, the adaptation of Diana Gabaldon's time-travel novels\n\nNot a hair product in sight: Sam's looks are left free to curl any which way they choose in Outlander\n\nOUTLANDER  \n\nSam Heughan plays fierce-yet-tender Scottish warrior Jamie Fraser in Outlander, the adaptation of Diana Gabaldon's time-travel novels. \n\nWith a thick Highland accent, Jamie wears a kilt and faces all that a Scottish soldier living 300 years ago might have had to, from being flung from a horse to having the skin flayed from his back.\n\nAs a laird-turned-fighter,  Jamie's key look is 'mucking out the horses', all while wearing a skirt. His knees seem to permanently covered in mud.\n\nOf his kilt-wearing, dashing actor Sam has admitted that he liked the experience.\n\nHe said previously: 'I thoroughly enjoy it. When I do have to put trousers on now, I sort of refuse and stomp my feet because riding a horse in a kilt is very liberating, very freeing actually. \n\n'And very comfortable. Also, should you ever need to do a nature relief, go to the restroom behind a tree, it's very quick, it's very easy. I recommend it for everyone.'  \n\nSwoon! Australian actor Travis Fimmel in Vikings has come a long way since his days modelling underwear for Calvin Klein...but would you mistake him for a hipster if was wearing a tight, white t-shirt? \n\nTravis first shot to fame in 2002 as the face of Calvin Klein's famous men's underwear range. His billboard posters were said to have caused traffic pile-ups in America, while the then 23-year-old became the first male model to be signed exclusively by Calvin Klein for an entire year, earning him a six-figure sum\n\nVIKINGS \n\nFormer Calvin Klein underwear model Travis Fimmel, 35, might not look out of place wandering down Shoreditch high street when he's dressed up as Viking king Ragnar Lothbrok. \n\nWith his hair shaved on the sides, a full beard on his chin and a greased-up quiff atop his head, there's certainly a distinct whiff of the hipster look him about when in character. \n\nIf the clang of chain metal floats your boat then this Viking family saga is brimming with rugged idols. Not that Fimmel particularly cares for his looks.\n\nPreviously known for his long hair, perfectly groomed appearance, six-pack and bulging underpants in the Calvin Klein days, the actor doesn't mind how he looks onscreen these days. \n\nHe told FEMAIL: 'I don't give a s*** about that. We've got a whole team to make us look good.'\n\nIf anything the actor finds the deliberate dressing up something of a chore. \n\nHe said: 'My hair takes 40 minutes and the costume takes 20 minutes to get into. It means I have to get up an hour earlier in the morning.'","Female fans captivated by new breed of 'pretty but gritty' male leads. Aidan Turner in Poldark perfects the rugged costume drama look.

From there, she went to a man's flat in Kelvinside, Glasgow.\n\nAfter a four-day hunt, her body was found at a farm on April 16.\n\nSpeaking at Worcester magistrates' court the following day, Mr Cadbury implied Miss Buckley had been drinking heavily on the night of her death.\n\nScroll down for video  \n\nReferencing Karen Buckley, Judge Cadbury said: 'It's very, very worrying how young girls put themselves in such very, very vulnerable positions' - prompting anger from domestic abuse and rape charities\n\nUniversity student Karen Buckley, 24, went missing on a night out in Glasgow. Judge Cadbury implied she had been drinking heavily on the night of her death, but her friends say she only had a few drinks \n\nSentencing Leanne Roberts, 21, who had assaulted someone outside a bar, he said: 'I find it incredible that young people can get so drunk that they don't even know who they're with.   \n\n'One only has to think about the horrible situation in Glasgow to see how serious this could have been. \n\n'It's very, very worrying how young girls put themselves in such very, very vulnerable positions.'\n\nLast night, campaigners branded his comments 'insensitive'.\n\nKatie Russell, of the charity Rape Crisis, said: 'It was wholly inappropriate, irrelevant and insensitive to make reference to the murder of Karen Buckley in this context and the timing of these comments was particularly distasteful.\n\n'Of course it's not unreasonable to advise young people, or indeed people of any age, not to drink alcohol to excess … But for a senior figure within the legal system to talk so specifically about young girls ""making themselves vulnerable"" in relation to gender-based violence … with specific reference to a recent murder, is unhelpful.' \n\nShe added: 'This reinforces the false notion that it is ultimately victims and potential victims who have the power and responsibility to prevent violence against women and girls. \n\n'In fact, only the perpetrators, who are mostly men, are to blame for violence against women and girls … and only they ultimately have the power to end it.'\n\nMiss Buckley's body was found on a farm north of Glasgow. Women's rights campaigners have said Judge Cadbury's comments as 'unhelpful' and making it seems like 'sexual violence is in some way inevitable'\n\nSarah Green, of campaign group End Violence Against Women, said: 'District Judge Nigel Cadbury seems to be perpetuating the idea that young women drinking alcohol put themselves at risk of attack.\n\n'Even if it is not meant, this implies sexual violence is in some way inevitable and it is women's responsibility to avoid it. It makes the perpetrators of these crimes all but invisible.'\n\nShe added that focus should be shifted 'to the men who choose to commit these crimes – because violence against women is not inevitable. We must start asking who commits rape and why … and what can we do to deter it.'\n\nDuring the sentencing, the court heard Roberts, of Ombersley, Worcestershire, had punched a woman outside a bar. She was given a six-month community order and a six-week curfew.\n\nMr Cadbury said: 'There is a drinking problem because she [Roberts] can't remember what she did … I am sure you are now aware of how vulnerable you made yourself.'\n\nAlexander Pacteau, 21, has appeared in court charged with the murder of Miss Buckley and attempting to defeat the ends of justice.\n\nIt is not the first time Judge Cadbury, who lives in a  £600,000 farm cottage in rural Worcestershire, has made controversial comments in court.\n\nHe previously refused to sentence a thief who siphoned off oil from a small village hall because he feared he might 'overreact'.\n\nHe said: 'My wife is on a small village hall committee. I feel very strongly about this sort of behaviour.\n\n'I feel I would overreact and consider that he should undoubtedly go to prison for this. It would be wrong for me to sentence him. I may be seen to be biased.'\n\nThe case was eventually transferred to another bench for sentencing.\n\nJudge Cadbury is a descendant of Cadbury's founder, John Cadbury, the businessman who set up the famous chocolate firm in the early 19th Century. He is believed to have a daughter and two sons.\n\nIn 2011,  was appointed a trustee of the Bournville Village Trust, which helps manage the model village set up by the Cadbury family for its workers.\n\nHe has also worked as a trustee of the Edward Cadbury Charitable Trust, which funds music, education and training in the Midlands.\n\nMiss Buckley disappeared from the Sanctuary nightclub, Glasgow.

However, a small number have the ability to travel through the body, creating new tumours as they go.\n\nThese cells are the 'root' of the cancer and for a treatment to work, they should be destroyed.\n\nIn future, doctors may be able to find these key cells in individual patients. \n\nThey could then be given drugs to wipe them out, with each patient's treatment tailored to the genetic flaw at the root of their cancer. \n\nThis should kill the new tumours and prevent more from forming, greatly improving odds of survival.\n\nCambridge University researcher Professor David Neal said some suitable drugs already exist, and that new ones are being developed all the time. \n\nHowever, he cautioned that it will be three to five years before the latest knowledge can be routinely put to use in the NHS.\n\nLead study author Professor Ros Eeles, from the Institute of Cancer Research in London, said: 'We gained a much broader view of prostate cancer by studying both the original cancer and the cells that had spread to other parts of the body.\n\n'We found that all of the cells that had broken free shared a common ancestor cell in the prostate.\n\n'The common faults we found in each man could potentially offer new targets for treatment.'\n\nCo-author Dr Ultan McDermott, from the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute in Cambridgeshire, described the finding as a 'potential Achilles' heel'.\n\nProfessor Peter Johnson, chief clinician at Cancer Research UK, said: 'This research lets us look right into the molecular core of cancer.' \n\nSamples were taken from tumours in the prostate and around the body in ten men with the disease (pictured).

Taser!"" in a tussle captured on a police body camera.\n\nBates told investigators that he mistook his firearm for the stun gun.\n\nHow easy is it to confuse a gun for a Taser?\n\nWhile Bates is at the center of the maelstrom over Harris' death, he isn't the only one under scrutiny.\n\nThe Oklahoma NAACP wants charges against other officers involved in Harris' death, and a state and federal investigation into the Tulsa County Sheriff's Office's treatment of minorities. The sheriff's office also finds itself fending off allegations that supervisors were told to forge Bates' training records.\n\nIn his interview Friday with ""Today,"" Bates said he had the documentation to show he had completed the necessary training required of reserve deputies.\n\n""That is absolutely the truth. I have it in writing,"" he told the show.\n\nAnd on Thursday, a sheriff's office official denied to the Tulsa World newspaper that any records had ever been forged.\n\nAs an advanced reserve deputy, sheriff's office policy calls for Bates to have completed 480 hours of the field training officer program, according to the Tulsa World.\n\nBates would also have needed firearms certification training.\n\nOfficials have yet to locate records showing what training Bates completed, said Maj. Shannon Clark of the sheriff's office.\n\nBut Clark did say it's possible that some training requirements may have been waived.\n\nSheriff Stanley Glanz has the authority to waive any department policies, Clark said.\n\n""The policies within our organization are signed off by the sheriff, but there are also policies that give the sheriff the ability to waive any policy within our organization. That's part of being a sheriff's office,"" Clark told the newspaper.\n\nGlanz told KFAQ radio this week that officials can't find records of Bates' firearms certification.\n\nThe instructor who provided that training is now a U.S. Secret Service agent, and officials haven't been able to locate training records she was supposed to have turned in, Glanz told the station.\n\nOther discrepancies have surfaced about training that Bates claims to have attended, including questions about active shooter and homicide investigation instruction.\n\nTulsa World reporter Dylan Goforth said the paper had been told by multiple sources that Bates' records had been falsified.\n\nThe newspaper has not said who allegedly asked the supervisors to falsify the training records or why.\n\nBut the orders apparently started years ago, ""back when (Bates) was trying to get on as a deputy,"" reporter Ziva Branstetter told CNN's ""New Day.""\n\nBates has donated equipment to the department and was also a donor to Glanz's re-election campaign, leading to allegations he had essentially paid to be a cop.\n\nHe rejected that claim in the ""Today"" interview as ""unbelievably unfair.""\n\nBates' attorney, Clark Brewster, also has rejected the allegations of poor training or forgery as unfounded.\n\nHe said those making the accusations include fired sheriff's office employees represented by the law firm that also represents Harris' family.\n\n""His training is extensive and certainly adequate,"" Brewster told CNN on Thursday.\n\nBates appeared on the ""Today"" show with his wife, two daughters and Brewster. He seemed composed but said he was still might be in shock over what had happened.\n\n""I can tell you it stayed with me for a number of days,"" Bates said. ""I'm not at all sure it's not still with me today. Lack of sleep, inability to concentrate, all of those plus more. You know, I still can't believe it happened.""\n\nIn describing the events leading up to Harris' death, Bates said he was parked several blocks away from the site where an undercover deputy was conducting a sting operation to catch Harris in the act of illegally selling a gun.\n\nBates said he had participated in ""several hundred"" such operations but always in a backup role where he would come in and ""clean up"" after deputies, taking photos and notes.\n\nBut as deputies rolled up to arrest him after the sale, Harris bolted from the vehicle and ran toward Bates' position.\n\nAs deputies were trying to subdue Harris, Bates told investigators he saw an opportunity to use his stun gun to help get the suspect under control.\n\n""I yelled, 'Taser! Taser!' as required in training. The deputy below me ducked, he pulled away from it so that I could,"" Bates said.\n\n""The laser light is the same on each weapon. I saw the light and I squeezed the trigger,"" Bates told ""Today.""\n\nThe result was not the staccato click of a well-deployed stun gun. Instead, it was a gunshot.\n\n""I shot him! I'm sorry!"" Bates is heard emotionally saying on video of the incident.\n\nBates apologized to Harris' family, who have rejected allegations he was violent and on drugs.\n\nHarris' brother, Andre Harris, said this week that he didn't think the shooting was racially motivated. Instead, he said, ""This is simply evil.""\n\nBut Bates,who is charged with second-degree manslaughter, said he didn't mean to kill Harris. His attorney has called it an ""excusable homicide.""\n\n""I rate this as No. 1 on my list of things in my life that I regret,"" said Bates, who is free on $25,000 bail.","""I rate this as No. 1 on my list of things in my life that I regret,"" robert Bates tells ""today"" he says he didn't mean to kill Eric Harris and rejects claims his training records were forged.

Saudi Arabia has nine million.\n\nCountries which had the fewest number of immigrants include Morocco with 50,000, Mongolia with just 17,000 and Greenland with only 5,000. Others with low figures include Tunisia, Papua New Guinea, Cuba and Guyana.\n\nThe top worldwide destinations for international migrants were the U.S., Russia, Germany, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, UK and France, according to the data. \n\nIt also revealed the areas in the UK where immigrants live, with London, Leicester, the Birmingham area and Bradford among those with the highest percentage. \n\nThe figures come after it emerged Prime Minister David Cameron had failed in his pledge to slash net migration to the tens of thousands before the general election.\n\nOfficial figures, released in February by the Office for National Statistics (ONS), show there was a net flow of 298,000 migrants to the UK in the year to September last year, equal to the population of a city roughly the size of Nottingham and up from 210,000 in the previous 12 months.\n\n \n\nThe increase in net migration was driven by a 'statistically significant' rise in immigrants arriving in the UK - up to 624,000 in the year to September 2014 from 530,000 in the previous 12 months. Around 327,000 people emigrated from the UK in the same period.\n\nMr Cameron and Home Secretary Theresa May had promised to slash net migration to below 100,000 by the end of the current parliamentary term.\n\nThe figures also revealed there were significant increases in immigration of non-EU citizens - up 49,000 to 292,000 - and European Union citizens - up 43,000 to 251,000.\n\nExperts flagged another statistically significant increase in Romanian and Bulgarian citizens arriving in the UK - up to 37,000 from 24,000 in the previous 12 months.\n\nOf these, 27,000 were coming for work, a rise of 10,000 on the year ending September 2013, the ONS added.\n\nAround 271,000 people came to the UK for work, up 54,000 on a year earlier, while immigration for study rose from 175,000 to 192,000.\n\nMadeleine Sumption, director of the Migration Observatory at the University of Oxford, said at the time: 'UK job growth is likely to be a key factor behind the recent increases.\n\n'If the UK's economic performance compared to the rest of the EU had been poor, then we might well have seen net migration fall, but that has not happened.\n\n'Rising work-related migration from outside the EU has also contributed.'\n\nDowning Street said the rise in immigration was driven in part by Britain's economic success relative to its neighbours in the eurozone.","Interactive graphic shows more than 231 million migrants around the world, with 7.8 million immigrants in UK alone.

The pain... LOL I'm happy for him but still... The pain...' \n\nThe hapless Belgian wrote: 'But marriage for the mujahideen especially for us, who come from Europe, is a big problem here...There is no mujahiras.' \n\n'Whenever you are going to marry someone...

'The results have been absolutely extraordinary.'\n\nDawn, who is now able to take her seven-year-old daughter on a dream holiday to Florida later this year thanks to her treatment, said: 'All my life I've been terrified of snakes. \n\n'But to sit down with one on my knee is just unbelievable.'\n\nThe Speakmans have now helped 60 people overcome there fears and phobias live on TV, from balloons and snowmen, to frogs and spiders. But today's was the first time viewers have been able to see the process in action.\n\nLifelong phobia: Dawn had been petrified of snakes ever since she watched B-movie Venom when she was seven years old\n\nTherapy: When presented with a tray of plastic snakes (pictured) she shook with fear and broke down in tears\n\nNik said: 'Usually we'll go into another room away from the cameras, and spend a bit more time with the person and it can take a fair amount of time. \n\n'But this time we spent just ten minutes going through it with Dawn, so viewers can see how we did it. It was very special as Dawn was the 60th person we've treated. We were thrilled at the result.'\n\nThe Speakmans had never met Dawn, from Scotland until five minutes before the show and knew nothing about her phobia until they saw a VT recorded in Dawn's home, showing how her life was being blighted by her phobia, known as ophidiophobia.\n\nDawn had been petrified of snakes ever since she watched B-movie Venom when she was seven years old, she explained.\n\n'If I see a snake on TV, I immediately have to get my feet up, the TV turned over. Then I'll go to bed that night I'll be checking under the covers.\n\n'I also check in the wardrobe where we keep all the shoes because you just never know, they could be hiding in there. I'll check in my boots, give them a wee shake, make sure there's nothing in there.' \n\nObsessive: Dawn used to compulsively check her home for snakes, and would frequently shake her boots to make sure they weren't hiding any\n\nPhilip asked her: 'Do you find it irrational? I don't know when a snake was last found in a loo in Scotland.'\n\nDawn replied: 'Yes. But I read a story in a newspaper once that someone had found a pet snake in the toilet, so ever since then I've checked.'\n\nDawn was then asked by Philip to scribble down the word snake on a piece of paper - sending her heart rate soaring from 90 to over 130.\n\nShe was also shown clips of Carl Fogerty with a snake slithering over him in the I'm A Celebrity jungle, as well as having to confront a tray of plastic toy snakes which made Dawn shake with fear and break down in tears. \n\nEva continued the session by getting Dawn to concede that her fear of snakes was indeed irrational, before pointing out the irony that in hunting for snakes around the house, she was seeking out her fear.\n\nIrrational? Dawn also used to check under the loo seat every time she was about to use it, despite living in Scotland, which is not known for it's teeming serpent population\n\n'What's happened is that you watched a film when you were seven years old and you reacted and created a schema,' Eva explained. \n\n'The reason you now react irrationally is because you're actually consulting a seven-year-old on how to react when you see a snake.'\n\n \n\nDawn was then asked to talk about Venom, the horror movie which ignited her fear of snakes in the first place, in which a snake kills everyone involved.\n\nNik then asked: 'So just from that one event, watching that film you're frightened of snakes? \n\n'You've been scratched by your cat but you're not frightened of it. What's a snake ever done to you?'\n\nHe added: 'You're frightened of something that's never hurt you, something that you've never physically held, that you only saw in a film when you were seven years of age. Does that make sense?\n\n'Essentially, for 30 years, you have victimised snakes for no reason at all.'\n\nRelief: After accepting that her fear of snakes was irrational, Dawn was able to touch a real-life 9ft Burmese python as it stretched out across her lap\n\nLogic: Eva (right) explained that it was essential to their techniques that the person being treated can feel the difference and see the evidence for themselves that they have overcome their fear\n\nThe Speakmans then held up a series of pictures of snakes to test Dawn's reaction. To everyone's amazement she remained calm and said: 'I can look at it.'\n\nNik remarked: 'This is the difference between seeing a snake through the eyes of a 30-odd year-old woman and not a seven-year-old child. You're looking confused right now. \n\n'That's because you've spent 30 years believing something that essentially is not true.'\n\nDawn was then presented with a tank of live snakes, and admitted that although 'bizarre', she was no longer has a phobia of them.\n\nAt the end of the show, producers brought out a giant, 9ft-long Burmese python which laid across the laps of Dawn and The Speakman's, with Dawn stroking the python. \n\nRemarkably, her heart rate stayed below 100. 'I never thought I'd be able to hold one,' she said.\n\nEva explained that it was essential to their techniques that the person being treated can feel the difference and see the evidence for themselves that they have overcome their fear.\n\nShe added: 'It's about proving to the person that their fears are completely irrational.'","Dawn Williamson, 39, had been petrified of snakes since the age of 9.

The shows will be unannounced until day-of-show, with tickets priced at $3 and limited to one ticket per person, to be purchased only at the venue on a first-come, first-served basis.\n\nBillboard: Jack White on Not Being a 'Sound-Bite Artist,' Living in the Wrong Era and Why Vinyl Records Are 'Hypnotic'\n\nThe purposely vague announcement surely has fans (and journalists) scouring the Internet for White's touring history.\n\nUnclear is whether White includes his work with The White Stripes, The Raconteurs and Dead Weather in his touring history, or just his solo road work. Presumably, he's including all of his touring, with all bands, as Billboard could find only 29 states in which he has performed as Jack White. Tour dates with White Stripes add another 12 states.\n\nThat leaves nine states for which we could not find a show for White: Hawaii (where a show is scheduled for tomorrow, April 15), Arkansas, Idaho, Utah, Wyoming, Vermont, Iowa, and North and South Dakota.\n\nBillboard: Jack White Plays The Hits, Declares 'Music Is Sacred' at Coachella\n\nThrough the process of elimination (surely he has played Boise, Little Rock, and Salt Lake?), our guess as to which five ""states"" White will play on the brief acoustic run: South and North Dakota, Wyoming, Vermont and ... Puerto Rico? If that's the case, this tour is in for some long jumps, with Puerto Rico to Vermont being a potential beast.

The boy Neymar gets a lot of publicity about the potential he's got, but I think that's still to be seen, still to be fulfilled.\n\n'Certainly, most people I speak to speak highly of the boy. When I had Anderson at United, he spoke volumes about the boy's ability.\n\n'So hopefully he'll be the next one who'll produce the type of talent we see in Messi and Ronaldo.'\n\nFerguson insisted that there is no standout player capable of rivaling Messi or Ronaldo at the moment\n\nThe two stars are undisputedly the top two players in world football, sharing the last seven Ballon d'Ors\n\nThe Premier League's most successful ever manager also backed Real Madrid boss Carlo Ancelotti, and revealed that the Italian reached out to Ferguson's son, Darren, when he was sacked by Peterborough in February.\n\n'Carlo is a top man,' said Ferguson. 'I was over at the Real Madrid game with Schalke and he was fantastic.\n\n'He came up and he knew Darren had lost his job at Peterborough and said ""Why doesn't Darren come and spend a few days at Real Madrid training? It will do him the world of good"".\n\n'He was fantastic. I can't say enough about that man. He is top drawer - a fantastic human being and a great coach.\n\n'Carlo is one of the best coaches I've ever come across and one of my biggest opponents, so I wouldn't worry about his future, that's for sure.'",Former Manchester United boss says no-one is close to world's top two. But Sir Alex Ferguson suggests Neymar will be the next to reach that level. Ferguson was also full of praise for Real Madrid boss Carlo Ancelotti.
