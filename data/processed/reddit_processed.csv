At about 25 seconds ( she had started just about 5 seconds behind me) I remember what is coming next, Cave Johnson shouting ""I'M GONNA BURN YOUR HOUSE DOWN!!"", and try my best to tell her ""WAIT WAIT PAUSE IT DON'T WATCH!"" too late...

FL, US\nMy boyfriend and I live in a managed apartment community, have lived here for about two years. We moved to this city in huge part because of the lower living expenses. When we moved in, we were told to expect increases of at least $25 on lease renewal, and last year the rent increased $27 which was *totally* reasonable. Currently we pay $936/month for a 2/2, which we split about 40/60.\n\nThe other day I got a renewal offer in my email, the lowest priced option was $1051/month, which is an increase of $115 a month and seems unreasonable. I called and spoke to one of the girls in the front office and was told she can regenerate the renewal offer in a week and see if the prices change, but the manager was not around so I couldn't get any more info\n\nWhat's the best course of action here? For background, we are doing okay financially(0 debt, we each have at least a 6 month emergency fund, there's money left over to save each month but not a ton), but we are planning to get married soon and the extra $115 a month is money I had mentally put aside for modest rings and a short honeymoon. Add to that, we will have about $2k in additional expenses in November outside of our regular bills... so the idea of our rent going up after that stresses me out.\n\nMy question is this -- is there anything we can do about this? I've looked up the law where I live and they are within their rights to increase the rent however much they want as long as they give us notice. I have drafted a letter detailing our excellent payment history, how we've never had any problems, mentioning the cost/risk of new tenants, etc., and suggesting that the max increase we will accept is 5%... but I'm not sure that this would have any effect.

I was calling the Utility providers in my area to set up the gas/water/elec for my new place, but I was informed that gas could not be set up due to owing a past amount. \n\nI am generally good about keeping up on those things, but am only human so I assumed I would have a small sum to pay. Maybe one months worth that I missed at the end of a lease or something like that. I was alarmed however when  I was told that the value was around $500.00 from a home that I shared with friends in college. They stated that this amount was accrued in 2013.\n\nI have spent the last 3 days trying to find the exact time when we moved from that specific house ( it was college, so we had a new place basically every year) and just now found out that the lease was over on 05/31/2012. Basically, whoever took over residency didn't change the service into their name and I did not request cancellation (first house, never had to pay utilities in the previously ""managed"" apartments as they were included in rent, other excuses). \n\nMy question is, am I really on the hook for these fees and what recourse could I possibly have? I cannot afford to pay it, but I also don't think that it should be on me TO pay it. Any advice is truly appreciated as I have not had any experience with this type of thing before."," Didn't cancel gas from a house in college. People lived there afterwards using gas in my name.

I will describe myself and what I am looking for based on my research as well as I can.\n\nMyself:\n\nI am a 23 y/o white male living in Atlanta and from Florida originally. My previous trips out of the country have all been to either Europe or the Caribbean and while I enjoyed them I am looking for something different this time. I really like the outdoors, wildlife, and thrill seeking. I used to swim and love all forms of water, but also enjoy a good mountain or rain forest. I took a couple years of spanish and could get to a passable level if necessary. I have a lot of vacation days to use before the end of the year and right now am planning on taking two weeks off for this trip.\n\nWhat I am looking for:\n\nThe above section applies to this one as well but I will try to go more in depth here. The best way I have found to describe what I'm looking for is an adventure. I haven't done well in pinning specific activities to how I want this trip to make me feel, which is why I'm asking you wonderful people, but I want to feel any or all of these: awestruck, humbled, risky, unconstrained, unfamiliar. I would like to go some place where I can see/experience a good variety of things and places during my trip, which means I wouldn't stay in one place for more than a couple days. I would prefer to avoid extra flights once there, but if it would open up a lot of opportunities I would consider one halfway through. I think that optimally I would rent a motorcycle or something (and drive a few hours every couple days)as this would fulfill several of my interests(variety of places, unconstrained, (slightly) risky, adventure). \n\nSummary /"," young guy wants to go on a two week foreign adventure to see/experience as many different awe-inspiring landscapes, thrill seeking activities, and cultures as possible.","[""The OP doesn't mention cultures \\nIt doesn't mention where he doesn't want to go""]",6.0,5.0,6.0,7.0,0.582220196723938,65.226,0.0,192.178006380796,0.3611911218104864,0.0,0.5257207155227661,0.8663363456726074,0.7876825332641602,0.8251393437385559,0.1013333333333333,0.0545977011494252,0.7037037037037037,0.0268096514745308,0.0144092219020172,0.1923076923076923,0.0693333333333333,0.0373563218390804,0.4814814814814814

Yesterday, he's heating up a frozen pizza on it and cuts it was what seems to be a butcher knife. He left 2 massive gauges in it. It really pissed me off but I went to my other buddies first to tell them about it. I told them what was wrong and asked if I was overreacting. They said I kinda was (I don't really think I was). I decided not to tell him about it because, it's a pan, whatever. Fast forward to today, he comes into my room with a new pan and angrily says to me ""I went and bought you a new pan because apparently ones with scratches in 'em don't work anymore."" Then he huffs and walks out. It's not even the pan that I'm mad about necessarily, it's that he treat my stuff like crap. That's what really pisses me off.

When we started dating, things were really great, really easy, and went really fast. Within a month we were already so close and I could see myself marrying this girl within a year or two (I'm 23, she's 26). We get along great, spend decent time together, and I can tell that she really cares about me. She has all the qualities of a good spouse, good mother, good life partner.\n\nWe've now been dating for 4-5 months and things are starting to slow down and I'm becoming less passionate about the relationship. I want to be with her, but i'm not crazy passionate about it. I don't wake up every morning with a burning desire to be with her, crazy about being with her. I know that it's unrealistic to have this feeling every minute of everyday, but I haven't felt that way since the first few weeks of our relationship.\n\nI also have to admit, even though it makes me feel shallow and a bad person, that my attraction to her isn't top notch. I am attracted to her, and we do have a physical aspect of our relationship, but she's not the most attractive women I know (or dated).\n\nI should also mention that we are both christain and that God is a central part of our relationship. Its something that we can share together and has been a good way to bring us together. I've slept with 2 girls before, she's a virgin, we have decided to wait before marriage to have sex. I'm ok with it, though I do fear that it will have an impact on our intimacy (possibly a source for my lack of attraction?)\n\nSo what should I do? Am i expecting too much from the relationship? Is physical attraction an unimportant thing in the long run as long as we have an intimate connection?

I spent a month trying to find jobs in my field, but knew that the pay I was receiving at the time would never match what my federal obligation would be.\n\nSo I jumped into a career in electrical work due to the fact that it was the only full-time position I could get in my area. I left my first electrical employer due to some stupid personal decisions on my end (job scams are the suck), but managed to enter the IBEW apprenticeship program.\n\nNow, being in the apprenticeship program did help pay the bills, but I live in a Deep Red State, and our Union is weak as piss. While I had the chance to preform some degree related work for a year, my job negligence did cost me an opportunity with an employer. I never have been one to be good that the politics game. \n\nSo now, I've been laid off the third time this year, due to contractors in our Local Union not having enough work for our labor hands. I know I'm getting to the point of having to switch career paths again, but I don't know if I can still do what my degree is in since a bulk of my job experience is in construction.\n\nI don't mind sharing my [Linkden Profile] for those interested in seeing my career history (it's not 100% up-to-date, as you can tell)."," Have I fucked away 4 years of my life after college and screwed up any benefit towards having a degree, as well as my career?","[""The summary doesn't ask the question that the writer has asked.

I didn't know what the website it was on was called so I just went into the history to find it there. There were a few porn sites like Pornhub, YouPorn etc there, but that didn't bother me. My Dad works nights a lot so he regularly takes the laptop with him, so I just assumed he would visit the sites then. There were also some of those ""HOT SINGLES IN YOUR AREA!!"" type things but I thought they were just some of those crappy ads that redirect you on porn sites. I deleted the history just in case it ever came up in the search box while other people were around, and I forgot about it until today. A family friend's computer is broken so she asked to come around later to use ours to print something out. I said sure, and checked the history just in case, but I found a massive list of cheating sites visited a week ago. There must have been about 11 or 12 different sited visited one after the other, sites like Ashley Madison, Easysex, along a load of others with names like ""MILFbang"" and ""Localfuck"". There's no way that this many sites could be the result of some scummy ads. I deleted the history again, but I now wish I'd at least taken a screenshot first.

Eventually I met A in February of this year and we started going on dates in March. We slept together in May...obviously we moved a bit fast but we both didn't really find it an issue. We saw each other a lot, whether it was just the two of us hanging out or the trio all together. In early May, R had to go away for military training for 2 weeks.

Consequently, she went out to a frat party got drunk, and proceeded to ""try and meet new guys to forget about me"" (her words). That ended in her babbling on to some interested guy about me until she threw up on him. At that point, she wanted to fix things, but I was too off put by the idea that she had moved on so quickly (trying to meet other people) to want to fix anything. But she begged and pleaded and explained and justified and as of right then, we decided we would talk when she came down for winter. It was mutually stressed that we were not together, nor were things fixed, but that we did think we owe it to ourselves to talk and see where we stood. \n\nLast night, out of frustration (both physical, emotional and mental), i went out and made a bootycall of another ex girlfriend. Afterwards, I felt weird. I felt a tinge of disgust for myself, but I could not really try and make myself feel worse because I was simply a single guy. There were no feelings attached to this incident on either side, just purely physical. \n\nNow my most recent ex is coming down to see me tomorrow, and to talk and see where we stand. Honestly, I do love her and i'd love to make things work between us, and there is a good probability that she feels the same.

She's single.\n\nShe knows me and that we're in a relationship, but I don't know if she necessarily respects that. While this wouldn't have bothered me if it were one of his long-time friends who sent it, she isn't super close with him. She also has had a history of (in my opinion) acting flirtatious with him and crossing some lines with her behavior, and a couple times, being really disrespectful toward me when I saw her in person. I get the impression that she's sneaky and manipulative - I think she has an agenda - but my boyfriend disagrees and thinks she's innocent and just trying to be friends.\n\nIn any case, a while back, I got pretty uncomfortable with her behavior, so I asked him to set some firmer boundaries with her. He did, and he actually ended up going a step further and distancing himself from her as a friend. They only talk every now and then, and she's not happy about that - she tries to contact him a lot, and posts a lot of passive aggressive posts on social media. I think she blames me for losing her friendship with him - which isn't necessarily untrue, but the reason I intervened was because of the way she was choosing to act in the first place. \n\nBut back to the current situation: to make it worse, he didn't tell me about the message even though we were on a trip together on valentine's day.

I am very noise sensitive, and sometimes when they fight about things it makes me feel really non functional and ruins my day.\n\nI was apartment hunting a bit because of this and found a place in the city that I thought was great. It's a little out of my budget long term, but it's month to month so I thought I could just get it for three months or so and not lose too much money on rent. I tentatively agreed to take it, but no money changed hands. The guy told me that someone else wanted it but that if I could pay the deposit before it her, the room was mine.\n\nThen two days went by where I didn't hear from the guy renting the place. I assumed that someone else had taken it and they just didn't want to tell me (this has happened to me a lot looking for a room share). \n\nHowever while time went by I started thinking about it and decided I wasn't sure about this place. The rent is hundreds of dollars a month more than I could afford, and I would have a lot of roommates (about 7), so it wouldn't even be quiet, which is the main thing I'm looking for. \n\nThe guy just got back to me today asking when I could make the deposit, and I had to tell him I wasn't sure I would. He wrote back saying they were counting on me taking the place and this would make a lot of problems for them.

But then if he chooses to abide his parents wishes he says he'll just be alone and not marry, meaning he isnt going to be happy... so confusing.

Turns out she was going to breakfast with her friend, and they've been hanging out all day.  I feel really jealous that she gave up on our plans to hang out with her friend instead.

Although we lived down the street from each other, my friend and her brother were sent to private Christian schools for the rest of their education, giving me fewer reasons to see her or her brother.\n\nYears pass, my friend's brother moves out of state for college, and she follows suite after she's done with high school, and I don't really hear from them until four years later when he moves back home and I decide to solicit his help on a website I wanted to make. I felt like we really bonded over this. He was really cool and incredibly helpful, funny, and smart to boot! Although he went to a private schools, he's very open-minded about civil rights issues, we have similar political affiliations, watch the same TV shows, and he isn't ashamed to like musicals.\n\nMy main problem is that I've had a history of horrible relationships. Not even horrible in the way most people think. I feel like there's a very strong chance I'm asexual. I've been in four big relationships that I felt helped me become the person I am today, and I'm thankful for it, but they all ended with the fact that I was unwilling to have sex with my partner.\n\nI feel a sense of security with him, because I know he would never do anything outside of my comfort zone. However I don't start a lot of relationships because I feel guilty about not being able to satisfy my partners. One of my biggest concerns is that if he does wind up liking me back, and we start dating, and something happens causing us to break up, this could mean bad things for our family's already fragile relationship.\n\nOKSO", I have a crush on my friend's brother I've known since we were 8. I'm worried that my sex issues and our family's friendship might be big hindrances. Should I let the feelings slide or go for broke?,"[""Makes up that they've known each other since they were 8; also some of the language is unclear (sex issues, go for broke)""]",4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,0.4380842745304107,104.87839721254358,0.0,218.15097003566805,0.4452164808402526,0.0,0.36043182015419,0.8586916327476501,0.7938554286956787,0.8250016570091248,0.1290322580645161,0.0709219858156028,0.7142857142857143,0.0345572354211663,0.0189573459715639,0.1951219512195122,0.0731182795698924,0.0401891252955082,0.4047619047619047

(I understand reddit is no substitute for that.)\n\nA little background. . . I have a 3 year old Australian Shepherd. He is very well behaved for the most part. He listens to all basic commands and makes good eye contact most of the time. He is quite defensive of the yard and property. If someone comes to the door or a loud car drives by he barks and growls. He quickly quiets down when you ask him to. (Most of the time except when he is in the yard alone) He gets along very well with other dogs and people. If someone new is coming to the house he is standoffish at first but quickly is very friendly. (As long as I say its ok) He is well excercised for the most part. (Walk to a field and then 45 minutes+ of running/fetch/frisbee) In the winter time he goes outside less but doesn't seem to act any differently. I do alot of indoor training/play with him as well.\n\nThe other day my friends phone rang and he stood up about to answered it. At the same time my dog started growling and attacked him. He stopped after a few seconds (gave him sit commands etc) but was still very heated. My friend went in the other room for his phone call and it seemed like my dog wanted to follow him. We both thought the ringtone agitated him.\n\nAre there any clear cut training methods to stop this behavior? It happened twice now with two different people. He is completely fine with the person before and shortly after it happens. It really comes out of nowhere. I have tried to replicate the scenario but haven't been able to. I have also shown him a ringing phone etc.\n\nAlso if anyone has tips about making him less defensive of the yard it would be great! Sometimes he barks at people that are 4+ houses away. Once he bolted out the door and barked and circled the mailman. I have watched a bunch of youtube videos and done alot of googling but haven't found anything that worked yet.I get that this particular breed is quite defensive., Dog attacked when friends cell phone rang and friend went to answer.

He's quite a quiet guy and I see him around every now and again on campus outside of work, but not much.\n\nThen I fucked up and caught feelings. \n\nHere's the kicker: because of timetabling availabilities, I haven't seen him since mid-December and I don't know whether it's weird for me to have feelings for him even though we haven't talked or seen each other for almost a month and a half.

I kept peppering this fucker with GoldBond and missed so many times until my bathtub and my girlfriend's bright pink towels were completely caked with this magical shit. The GoldBond seemed to do pretty well in slowing it down because I finally caught one of its legs with a tweezer and proceeded to torture and dissect it.

I know he basically loved her and pined for her all through high school and didn't entirely get over her until he met me. They occasionally kept each other updated by hanging out when they were both in their hometown or fb messages. She often says ""I miss you"" etc. which makes me a little uncomfortable.

I feel like she may treat him the same now when she says things like that. \n\nShe emailed him a while ago that she was coming to visit him. He told me of it immediately. She hadn't given any details but made it seem like her trip all the way was just to see him. I was uncomfortable and wasn't even in town at the time and expressed that to my boyfriend. He immediately told her not to come see him because I said so. It was only then that she revealed that she was visiting her family there along with her current boyfriend and it wasn't a trip just to see my boyfriend. \n\nI was a little embarrassed of this... but still feel like my boyfriend shouldn't have so bluntly told her it was my fault! It felt like he confided in her something that was between us and it just felt wrong! I trust my boyfriend completely but am so scared now that he confides in her things that are personal to us.

Am I being dumb?\nSo my girlfriend and I have been together for about 6 months, we are both 21 years old.  The relationship has been awesome, we have had minor differences but no huge fights.  I know that we are still a fairly young couple, but bear with me.  I'm not a very promiscuous guy (I've slept with only one other person before my current girlfriend, and the other person was a girl who I dated for a year).  Basically, I don't really sleep around.  This weekend, for some reason, I asked my girlfriend for the first time how many guys she has slept with. She told me I was the 9th guy. I was expecting around 3 or 4.  To me, she doesn't seem to be the type of girl who sleeps around (I don't even know if 9 guys qualifies as sleeping around).  Even in our relationship, being comfortable sexually is something we have had to work on.  That's why I was kind of shocked when she told me I was the 9th guy she's slept with.  She told me that she used to view sex as not very meaningful, but that it is very different with me.  She's told me numerous times that I mean a lot more to her than any other guys ever have.  I'm not mad at her, because I know that I can't be mad at her for doing stuff before we even knew each other.  I'm just a little uneasy/put off by the number of guys she's been with.

It's hard to explain but I became very attached to this person, so much so that I would get very anxious when they were away from me. It made me uneasy when ever she was out or away.

I felt as though she is wasn't really interested in me, and I would do things to make her jealous. \n\nI had really high self esteem going into the relationship, but it got lower and lower during my time with her. It felt as though she always kept me at an arms length, saying she has to maintain her independence. She kept secrets, and didn't really communicate to me. She would flirt with other guys. When I told her my feelings that I don't appreciate that, she said that she can do what ever she wants that she's a grown woman. \n\nIt's confusing me because with my ex-ex-gf, it was different.

His biggest breakthrough has been that he wants to create art and doesn't care which means it takes to support himself. Even settling on a career in art wouldnt bother me, but he just wants to create art and is not interested in making a career out of it. Doesn't want any kind of career it seems, but I find myself embittered by how selfish that feels, because I work so many hours.\n\nLong story short he just refuses to think about any practical parts of life, how to sustain a life financially (maybe because he is willing to get help from his parents when he needs it?). In the meantime, I want to be able to plan trips, live together, invest in a dog, etc. Every element that requires planning seems impossible. I get frustrated by the thought of everything falling on my shoulders, but I also appreciate the emotional support and distraction he provides me from my career-driven life.

About about halfway through, I graduated and left university. Since then, we've been doing long-distance, but it's only about a 2 hour drive (I understand this is not a vast distance). Since then, I've tried my best to visit, sometimes she does (once every 3 weeks at most, typically every two weeks with back-to-back weekends not uncommon). She can be a bit needy and clingy. I try to cater to those needs, within reason. I send care packages, talk to her often, and do my best to spoil her when we do see each other. I do my best to keep our romance.\n\nHowever, when we are apart she finds herself sad and second guessing the relationship.

She is a good person, the type of woman I want to be with and have a future with. Unfortunately, she's apprehensive because she sees sadness as a component of being long-distance.

We were incredibly close during our year and a half together, and had a mutual breakup because we wanted to see new people/ I graduated college and got a full-time job about an hour away. Our breakup was mutual, and after a couple of months of no-contact, we recently rebuilt our friendship.

Sometimes we'd be having a fairly in-depth conversation (that she sometimes brings up), or she'd be ranting to me about something, when all of a sudden, her messages just stop. I realize that there are probably a number of reasons why she may not be replying; she's a lot more social than I am and often talks to multiple people at once, not all of my messages warrant a response, or that she's just busy, but it's still fairly annoying to see, especially since I'm the sort of individual that tries to send some sort of acknowledgement to all messages that I receive, or tell them if I can't talk at the moment.

She turned it down, saying that she would stay with me, but it will be over if I ever watch pornography again.

I have an unpaid internship lined up with very good prospects that it will turn into a paid position after I complete it, and am actively searching for other part-time work to supplement income in the mean time. I am currently living off of a monthly allowance that my parents send me until I secure a job (covers rent and utilities, but barely any left over). I have about ~$800 in credit card debt due to me being financially stupid.\n\nRecently I remembered that as a child my parents set aside about 2k in (I think) a Charles Schwab account for me to ""invest,"" but really didn't offer much guidance and it's never actively been invested.

The car accident was pretty minimal honestly (my airbags didn't deploy/car function fine/only cosmetic damage).  A cop was called and took accounts and photos.  The guy seemed irritated but not hurt in the least.  I gave him/the police my insurance and contact information.  As far as I knew he took care of it and I hadn't heard from him.\n\nApparently, the cop miswrote my cell number (making a 1 look like a 7) and the guy had been trying to contact me.  I found out my insurance policy that had been in effect was cancelled due to lack of payment (I was on my parents insurance and I was unaware they hadn't paid/they did not inform me).  I got my own insurance asap but I found out I was basically boned because I technically didn't have insurance during the time the accident occurred.\n\nThis morning I received a manila envelope on my car windshield addressed to me.  In it, the guy wrote me a letter describing his attempts to contact me.  Additionally, he included a large amount of my information he could find online (facebook photos, employee page, white pages info, etc.).  He also included the incident report and two quotes for repairs to his damages.

She has also told me to get over it and even is trying to set me up with her cousin who I liked in the past. So she is no help even though she has seid she would be dating if her and her bf never meet. \n\nThen I talked to my therapist about my issues with her and it was a helpful conversation but it left me with a delmia.

How will this help my tax returns?\nThis is my first post ever on Reddit so please bear with me. \n\nA little backstory to begin, when I was a child my father bought 2.3 acres of property in a school district that he wanted us to attend in South Carolina. The hope was one day to build a house, however, as time passed that never materialized. We've owned the property for 20 years and over that time we've paid property taxes, sometimes late in the face of financial instability. Currently, we're doing better but still its an unnecessary financial burden and we'd like to capitalize on the property value having doubled since when we purchased, valued at $30,000 currently. We hired a realtor to sell the property a couple months ago but it has sat without much interest.  \n\nWe discovered our neighbors have been removing the for sale signs because they don't want someone to build on the wooded lot. We have left letters in the community's mailboxes detailing the problem. Without knowing which neighbor is doing it, we can't report them. Though the property is listed online, I'm pretty upset that there's not a on-site advertisement. In my frustration I was trying to think of alternatives while possibly irking the neighbors. I came up with an idea that actually was feasible and not too dramatic. We could either donate or sale the land for a reduced price and use it as a tax deduction; we considered Habitat for Humanity or Helping Hands. The problem, I know very little about about the tax deductions allowed/ how it would be applied.

I'm a pretty confident, outgoing woman and have asked out men on several occasions. I don't tend to be too shy if I really want something, however, can be in some situations. \n\nI was at the grocery store today at lunch time and was waiting in line to check out. There was a woman who was having difficulty checking out with her multiple credit cards and people in line were noticeably getting impatient. There were two people in front of me in line, and the person directly in front of me was a very cute guy. Sometimes in these situations people kind of glance around to others waiting for visual commiseration of some sort, surely many of you reading have probably experienced this. \n\nThe cute guy kind of glanced back at me and smiled but I had one of my headphones in listening to music, so I nodded back. I kept noticing him kind of attempting to look my way (or possibly he was just annoyed and waiting, hard to tell). \n\nI kept thinking, ""huh, I'd love to find a way to give this guy my number"". It's hard enough to meet people you think are attractive or interested in dating. I haven't had any real luck with online dating (especially in my current city, which defaults to a hook up culture) and have been thinking about how to meet people in person. \n\nSo I put this to you: how does one takes this kind of situation to the next level?

She was drinking (too much) with 2 of her friends and 5 other people she did not know, on a camping beach, near a lake. Nobody was sober enough and some of them took a midnight bath while clearly drunk. I hope I am not overreacting if I think that it is dangerous, mainly because the drowning risk… Anyway, I realized that even if I gave her some big brother drinking advice (things like « if you don't feel like drinking because suddenly, the taste of alcohol kinda disgust you, it is time to stop, no matter what your friends tell you to do, you will not have a good time if you continue »), I never mentioned certain situations (like drowning while drunk).\n\nIn particular, It made me realize that I never told her something like « dudes flirting with you while drunk sometimes misinterpret your signals (by clumsiness or malignancy) and bad things can happen to you, so do not get too drunk with people you barely know/trust to be able to react well if it happens ». I want to tell her that and I want to make her understand that it is serious, but something I've understood by reading feminists books/articles is that many women live in a constant (and horrifying) fear of rape, and when some asshole rapes a woman, this woman often feels some guilt, feeling that it's her fault, that she should have been less clumsy, put on less sexy clothes, drunk less, etc.\n\nI do not my sister to feel that way, and moreover, I do not want to be a part of the transmission of this rape culture which blames victims! On the other hand, I want her to understand that this is a serious issue and that even if, in an ideal world without rapists, she shouldn't have to worry about it, she should be aware of this issue and avoid stupidly risky situations.\n\nHow would you advise me to phrase my advice to her?

After every tense situation, I am the one apologizing and I understand I haven't handled things exactly as she wanted, but it worries me how few mistakes she has admitted and how empathetic she is not.

Each time I apologize she accepts it as if I said ""it won't happen again"" instead of accepting it because it was an honest miscommunication or mistake. Similarly, she rarely apologizes because she is who she is. I'll admit that she makes very few mistakes but the ones she makes are very personal like not paying attention to me when I am sad or not acknowledging the legitimacy of my feelings. She is an affectionate person but only on her own time. There are very specific occasions that people need a hug or a shoulder and she does not look for ways to console me in those times, despite my requests that she be more attentive.

I agreed but not formally, at that time knowing that it was probably going to be in Mexico. This was a year ago and no details were known.

Will have to get a suit/tux at a cost of another couple hundred dollars. To me, this is a crazy amount of money to ask your friends to spend. \n\nThe problem is, I can afford it.

It felt like someone had snuck up behind me and thrust a long thin knife into my spine.

There was a lot of manipulation, and even though I was glad to be out of the relationship, it took me about a year to recover from it. I have rebuilt my confidence and now I have an ecosystem of happiness again.

About a month later, she visited her family again and we hung out a couple of times. It was fantastic and I really started to like her.

I didnt really want to leave my current position, so I told him I would take the weekend to think it over.\n\nLater that night, i was exhausted and fell asleep early. I woke up to loud noises in the kitchen. So i walked in there and found my gf packing her shit up in a bag.

Any advice is appreciated...\nHere's the story:\nIn December 2011, my wife and I made an offer on a home, which was eventually accepted.  The home was a foreclosed property, owned by Aurora Mortgage Services.  Closing date, dictated by the seller, was to be February 10th, 2012 (tomorrow).  We fulfilled our end of agreement - provided earnest money deposit, secured financing, obtained insurance, and as far as we were concerned were ready for closing.  As a matter of fact, title agency (again, dictated by the seller) contacted us and scheduled the time for the actual close.  However, on Tuesday, February 7th, we were notified that Aurora has placed all of their assets on hold ""until further notice"", but that periodically, properties will be ""released from hold"" - whatever that might mean.  \nI've done some research online and came up with [this blog]  It appears that we are not the only ones currently dealing with this.\nSo now, our options are to file for an extension, or get our earnest money back and walk.  By choosing the later option, we loose out on the inspection money, appraisal and cost of gas that had to be turned on for the said two things (all together around $1,000).  We don't necessarily want to walk, because we like the house, but our current lease is set to expire next month.  We have no indication that this will be resolved by that point.\nHas anyone ever experienced this while dealing with foreclosures?

As I know, he didn't *actually* cheat on me, however in my heart it feels the same--if not worse because he actually PURSUED a relationship, not just sex.

I RICE'd it and saw my PT, but no matter what I was doing I still had to take some time off of running.\n\nI got really depressed pretty much right away and in an effort to keep myself sane I turned all of my normal running energy to strength training.

I tripled the number of push up I can do and I quadrupled the length of time I can hold plank.\n\nBut here's the amazing part- today I went out for my first run since July 19th and I felt so good and so light, yet strong. I felt fast but I told myself that it was probably just because it'd been so long. But when I checked my pace at the end- sure enough it was about 25 seconds faster than my old ""normal"" pace. In fact, my pace was the fastest I've ever run that distance (3 miles). And I didn't stop running because my body had to, I felt like I could've kept going for another hour at that same pace!

He says he thought she was perfect, and that his senior year when he was dating her was the best of his life. But that then she went to school and decided he wasn't as important to her as she had said. That messed him up, and he admits he shouldn't have believed she was perfect. But he says ever since that break up he hasn't felt capable of feeling deep feelings, and that now he is feeling anxious because he thinks maybe we are at that stage...and that so far he has been very guarded (I have too).\n\nI got upset because that means at the beginning of the relationship he knew he couldn't feel deep feelings. I didn't think that was fair to me. And I don't want to have to ""coach"" someone into feeling again...I shouldn't have to. It also seems like he's not over her...but he claims he is enough and no one is ever COMPLETELY over another person. Am I right in being upset? I have no idea how to proceed from here...\n\nAnd an outside issue--for the past few days I have been really distant with him because frankly he was annoying and I am pretty pessimistic about us spending longer than 2 years together (that is when I graduate)...I haven't told him that.", Boyfriend of six months finally says he may be able to develop deep feelings for me...but apparently has been closed off and incapable of doing so for our whole relationship thus far.

Everything was perfectly fine but all of a sudden I hear a ""BANG BANG"" really fucking loud and I was in the pen inside the building and during the loud BANG I heard yelling, then my stomach just dropped I was sure it was gun shots or something. It was extremely loud and had a Pop-ing sound So I droped the shovel and what I was doing and jumped over the walls seprateing the pens then sprinted out the back door onto a trail. After I got out far enough I called my Father warning him not to go the the Agriculture area. After the trail ended at a no trespassing sign I ran through bushes and branches getting scraped up until I reached the clearing where I ran down to the schools office. The first thing they notice is im shaking, sweating, and stuttering like a motherfucker and asked what happend. I reported the incident and someone went up to check it out. Turns out what happend was one of the older boys that were up there was angry and he has some issues so he grabed a pig cane and smashed it against the building twice breaking it. It takes alot of force to break one of those or even dent a building which lead me to belive it was a gun shot. But I don't know I just feel like a bit of a coward and a idiot all at the same time and feel kinda bad about myself a little bit. The boys both aplogized to me but i still feel like a jack ass.

Throughout the relationship she stressed that she wasn't one for relationships and was only involved in one with me because she loved me so much (we were each our first serious relationship).\n\nThroughout our time together she kissed another guy once and swore it'd never happen again and broke up with me once only to reconcile a week later and apologize. Around 5 months ago she broke up with me again, saying shewanted to be single her final year of college. She claimed she still loved me and if she had to be with someone it'd be me.\n\nI tried to move on and cut contact but she kept finding a way to stay relevant in my life, even though several times I asked her if she wanted to get back together to which she replied no. She said she jusy wanted to hook-up with other guys, which she has during our time apart.\n\nAs I've said, she's kept in contact despite me asking her to stop and have even had to take her to the hospital at one point. A week ago she showed up at my house saying she missed me and we agreed to meet for lunch to sort things out.\n\nAt lunch we agreed we still loved each other very much and that we should take things slowly. She says that if she finds that I'm not what she wants that she will end it for my sake. It's been a few days now and i just can't help but feel that she isn't nearly as serious about us as I am.\n\nMy question is should i even bother with the relationship at this point?

An interesting example is the driver-less car that Google is developing, not only will it affect everyday commuters, but it will effect industries where driving is the primary source of income, trucking, cabs, pizza delivery, etc. I feel sweat shops in China aren't even safe. Why pay a human being who will most likely get fatigued, burnt out, or demand better pay/working conditions when they can be replaced by machines that only require basic maintenance?\n\nIt will be interesting to see how society and the economy adapts, as automation will turn us on our head. Especially when you think about basic economics, if potentially billions of people are going to be put out of a job in the next twenty years, they will no longer have income. Without income they can no longer buy the products being manufactured, which in turn would cause product manufacturing to recede on all fronts. No matter how you look at it, the current economic model will not be able to adapt well to full automation of the world. \n\nIt's terrifying and exciting at the same time.

I am sure she's been planning this day for a while in her head, but the only two details I've heard so far is that it is a ""$60k wedding"" and ""the groom/his family"" pays for it.  For reference, she is not from the U.S. originally (although she became a citizen in her teens), so her culture is weighing in here.  Her culture (middle eastern) is big on over-the-top events and the professional success to back it up.\n\nWe can technically afford this wedding, as between us we make about $300k/year, but I come from a lower middle-class background and spending $60k on a single event just seems preposterous.  It might even cause negative feelings with my family because no one has had a wedding that cost even half that much.\n\nThe problem is that I don't want to just say ""no"" because then I would look cheap.  I believe that she should get the day she wants, but I also think she could have just as great of a wedding on less (maybe $20-30k), so my challenge is to convince her that she could be happy, especially if it means we can keep it from impacting other milestones.  For example, she has already started talking about buying a house in the next 1-2 years.  Well, the average house exceeds $1 million in our area, so an expensive wedding is going to push that timeline back by a year or so if we are to contribute equally to the downpayment. (I'm 100% footing the bill for the wedding, remember).  We also both agree on trying to become financially independent of work as soon as possible, and are in general frugal people.  For example, we live in an old, cheap apartment, and she recently bought a used car.\n\nWhat can I do here?

She's obviously sick of being cooped up, but for the most part has been entirely chill about the whole process, but I was expecting a bit of a backslide in her training. \n\nRecently (last two weeks) she's been barking at people she doesn't recognize when I'm walking her to the bathroom at night.  To be fair, this is a relatively new apartment/ area for her, and she's been laid up and hasn't been able to explore/ meet the neighbors.\n\n  It usually goes down like so: Milly sees a person in the distance and goes on alert (ears up, tail up, eyes focused). I usually at this point try to distract her with a, ""Hey, Milly, it's just our neighbor.  thanks for letting me know they are there!"" If they keep walking toward us, or we keep walking toward them, she usually breaks into the crazy greeting dance of her people (total wiggle butt, hoping side to side, ears up but relaxed).  We're working on a more relaxed greeting.  At this point I usually make her sit and stay by my side until she calms down.  \nWell, if they don't move toward us (fair enough when she's clearly on alert), or she isn't allowed to get closer/ investigate she will bark.  Not a low bark, but a higher ""hey, you! Friend?"" kind of bark.  At this point I say, ""enough"" sternly and work with her until she will heel beside me and then we sit calmly once she's away from the stimulus. Once she completely calms down and has listened she gets a ""thank you"" and a treat.  I have a feeling this will go away once she has a chance to run/ play/ explore/ say hi to the neighbors and get some energy out, but maybe not, and I would like to curb the habit of barking at people, especially because she is rather large (in comparison to most dogs in the building) and sometimes she barks at people that already seem afraid of her.", Dog barks at strangers usually just at night.

He was always really busy and I felt neglected, so much so that I ended the relationship. We had the best sex I have ever had in my life though. We've remained friends.\n\nThen I began to date this other guy, Tom. Tom and I were together for two and a half years. We lived together and everything was great until it wasn't anymore. He is 28 and I'm 25 and he just stopped being attracted to me I guess, because he would never try to sleep with me. I had to initiate everything and half the time he would reject me because he was on adderall or something. We didn't click sexually. In fact, when I told him how I wanted rough sex, he replied about how he ""isn't into rape"" and made me feel really shitty. I broke up with him last Thursday (it was very civil, he didn't try to get me to change my mind, it's very obvious he's no longer interested) and he is in the process of moving out. He's not staying at my house, he is just packing on the weekends (while i stay at my sisters) and should be out by the end of this weekend.\n\nI have been talking to my ex lately about my breakup and he's really been supportive.

Neither of us want to date again, we just both agreed it was like the best sex ever. My question is - do I go down the sticky friends with benefits road with my ex? I don't want to ""ruin"" our friendship, but we've already had sex before and I kind of feel like this would make our friendship stronger. He's the most open person ever sexually, we explore all kinds of fantasies.

We've had a fairly tumultuous relationship - we both struggle with anger, and it leads predictably to a lot of fights. We've both been in counselling, and that's calmed down a lot. We've both been guilty of some nasty shit, and we've tried to forgive and leave it in the past.\n\nHowever, there is one thing we've never been able to settle down on. I am decent with money, and she spends it like it grows on trees. I grew up in a lower middle-class household, and she grew up in a wealthy one. The issue is, although I hold down a good job as an engineer, I still expect her to contribute. We've struggled a lot with getting her to be responsible with money, and she's repeatedly admitted to spending all of her savings on useless shit - including junk food, when I pay for a personal trainer. \n\nI know, it's her money. It's not my business. However, she's promised me repeatedly that she's saving her money, and that became important recently when she lost her job. After that, it all came out of the woodwork - most of her savings are gone, some spent on her student loans, plenty spent on more useless shit and cheating on her diet. She has enough savings for maybe two months paying her necessary bills, which don't include paying me for room and board. I have counseled her repeatedly to make sure she has enough in savings for room and board for several months. Apparently she ignored it. \n\nThis has happened before. She's never consistently paid me rent out of her own paychecks. When I've gotten rent, it's been from student loans for room and board.

About a year and a half into our relationship I was checking his internet history just to find an old website with a recipe I made for dinner before. I usually don't mind my boyfriend watching porn. It's completely unrealistic to think guys don't fap. But I found out he had been messaging the girls on the subreddit complimenting them. I flipped out naturally because that was crossing the line. He said he was addicted to porn. He went to talk to a therapist who said he didn't need to be treated. I felt betrayed but still forgave him. \n\nFast forward 6 months: I find myself constantly needing to check his phone and computer to see if he watches it still or messages girls. I feel more insecure than ever. He caught me looking on his phone history. I was honest and told him that I was looking to see if he still is watching porn in random moments like he used to. What do I do? I don't like being like this. I want to trust him. I'm scared he is going to keep on doing it behind my back. \n\nAm I overreacting?, my boyfriend messaged girls on sexy subreddits and I caught him.

Once I got to the Fortaleza airport the flight got delayed a couple of hours but the TAP staff guaranteed us that we wouldn't miss the transfer flight in Lisbon even though it would be a very tight time schedule. Once in Lisbon we (pretty much everyone who was going to Stockholm) ran to the gate just to be denied boarding under the excuse that our luggage wont make it to this flight so we couldn't board, when asked if they could just let us board anyway and then send our luggage the TAP staff girl just said they wont do it. We all went to the transfer desk, pretty upset, only to find a huge line of people from other flights already complaining about their situation. From the 3 attendants in the transfer desk, only 1 was working and the other two just calmly said to us ""We cant help you, you should get in line and wait over there."" There were pregnant women, people with babies, elderly and everyone stressing out because it has been over 2 hours and the line hasnt move a thing. Soon enough chaos starts and I hear the TAP woman screaming to a customer ""You shut the fuck up! And you too sir!"" (in portuguese). \n\nThats when I pick up my phone and start filming when a lady which was in line with us says: ""You better put that down, you dont have any permission to film here and if you continue, I am allowed to throw your phone away."" I said it would be illegal of me to publish it but Im filming it to myself and I can do it. She said she was from the press and she knows the law and I cant do that. I didnt want any trouble because it was already a mess over there so I put my phone down and told the lady to fuck off and so we stayed in line until after much trouble, we managed to get home the next day. \n\nSo reddit?

What I'm about to write is what I've heard from her.\n\nShe went out for a Christmas party with work colleagues and as usual involved dinner and drinks/clubbing. At the end of the night she and her senior (A), who has a higher position, married with children, offered to walk her home. She agreed as she was a bit drunk at this point.\n\nPrevious to this she has talked about A as a mentor who has guided her through the new job an given her some good career guidance. Needless to say she trusted him as a friend.\n\nAnyway, once they were at her home he started making very aggressive advances including trying to remove her dress, kissing her & inappropriate touching. All the while she was saying 'Stop, this isn't right, you have a wife' etc. She made it quite clear about this. He continued and at one point he had removed his pants and was trying to get her to perform oral sex on him. Again she refused and he left shortly after. \n\nShe is extremely upset about this and doesn't want to report it to HR or the police as she doesn't want to relive it and would rather forget about it and try to move on, she believes this will give her closure. I can completely understand but to me the situation is much worse then she is giving off and this needs to be reported to their HR department at the very least.\n\nSince the night occurred she has only told a couple of friends (who do not know A) and me. One friend has told her not to do anything about it and says things like this happens, to me this is completely the wrong thing to say and trivialises the situation. \n\nAt the moment she is very upset and angry, (as am I, I feel by not being there I can't do anything) and would rather forget about what happened.

If for example my bf is out for the night and not responding to texts that's ok and I'm not going to interrogate him or go through his texts when I see him, I just mean in a more general sense, as in I feel being reserved and protecting myself/not trusting him all the way is just the right thing to do generally. I have felt this way in all relationships I've ever had and I see no reason to change really. You never really know someone's true thoughts or feelings, and if you open up you are just going to get hurt, so why not enjoy your relationship while also protecting yourself on some level. He (or anybody else) will never have me completely but I don't think our relationship suffers for it.\n\nCan anyone explain why this is so important to many people? I am not a sociopath I swear, just cautious and I don't see why I should change, but it is a problem to other people I have dated. I feel you can enjoy relationships and love without a deep level of trust and it's not as important to me as it is to others.\n\nETA many are reacting negatively which is what I expected/is unsurprising, I already know people get upset about this.

Anyway, so I got another CC that had preapproved me and will be receiving it shortly. Is there any reason not to use it for literally every purchase I would normally use my debit for and pay it off every month? I know the point is they make money when you don't and when you overspend, but I'm super tight with my money, have a few grand saved and a job lined up and literally no expenses that my current graduate assistantship doesn't pay for (with about $400 left over each month).

My girlfriend's ""name"" is Megan, and my 2 friends involved are ""Julia"" and ""Hannah""\n\nI hope to make this brief.  So my girlfriend and I have been dating for 6 months, she is fabulous, our relationship is really great. However, I learned something today that I found slightly troubling.  Long story short, it seems my girlfriend doesnt like very much when I hang out with my two friends Julia and Hannah.  Today my gf was out of town for something school related, so I hanged with my two friends.  I always gave Megan info like ""yeah i think ima hang with Julia and Hanna when you're out of town"" and she usually says something like ""haha okay sounds good.""  And I ask her ""you're fine with that right"" and she'd say ""With Julia? Ya of course."" There has been a few times where like we'd go to Spot coffee and get some food together, always the 3 of us (Me, Julia, and Hannah). I have always believed Megan had not cared... until today.  \n\nToday Julia and Hannah told me that Megan isnt always very nice to them.  Such as, giving ""looks"" to them in the hall.  Or not saying Hi if they see each other.  Apparently Megan only says hello and stuff when Im with her.  Anyway, I never knew this.  As I said, Megan always seemed perfectly fine with me hanging out with my friends.  In addition, she has a good amount of guy friends, so its not like she doesnt understand..  I hang out with Megan a lot, just not ALL the time, I like hanging with friends too.\n\nIn the end, I would like to talk to Megan about this (In person, not text).  How can I bring this out without sounding like I am ""accusing"" her, I just wanna talk about their concerns.

Fortunately I was able to cut off the water before any further damage could happen.  When I had a plumber come out to fix the pipes, he basically laughed when he went up to the attic and saw the plumbing system that had been installed by the previous home owner.  In the attic, there was a maze of exposed CPVC (no insulation jackets) pipes all through out the attic.  They were also raised about 2-3 feet in the air with NO hangers.  The plumber said it was basically a disaster waiting to happen and that the only real solution would be to have the entire attic re-piped correctly.  He said he could replaced the broken pipes, but it would just result in another break during the next deep freeze so we went ahead and replaced the entire attic and we are setup with a good PEX system, with a fiberglass insulation sleeve, and the pipes now run low enough to where insulation can be placed on top of it also so we should be good for the future.\n\nSorry, long lead up, but my question is:  Before we purchased our house in 2012, we had it inspected by a home inspector for $400 or so.  He provided us a pretty detailed report about some issues, but NOTHING was mentioned about the shoddy plumbing system that was just waiting to fail.  I went back and looked at the report again to confirm, but I also noticed that apparently ""Private Water systems"" are out of the scope of their inspection/report which I think is RIDICULOUS...  We were first time home buyers and needed an true professional inspection to let us know of any potential problems before purchasing the house.  Do I have any recourse with our inspector?  The plumbers and the insurance adjustor that have come out have both stated that they are amazed the house passed inspection with a water system like that in the attic.

Even now as I type this I can't really turn it off.\n\nI think its most troubling when having sex. Instead of getting into the zone, I am constantly thinking about all this other bullshit.  How she perceives me, how animalistic it feels, etc.  The best sex (and perhaps social interactions in general), have always been drunk.  Being drunk is the only time I can really get into the zone and turn of the internal dialogue.\n\nIs there anyone else experiencing this?  I'm sure everyone does to some extent but I feel other people have better control over it.

Although we have the same type of job at different places, mine just seems to come with more responsibility and more demands and expectations.  I am also pretty high-up in a field which is mostly men, and I feel I have gotten this far by always being better than the men to be considered equal.

We may not have much similarities, but that's one of the reasons why I love him, because I learn so much from him.

He would tell me about his friends and his day but I can feel that he holds things back, especially when it's about a certain person.

He wouldn't know that someone is flirting with him unless they tell him upfront and he wouldn't know that he was flirting back or entertaining other girls unless someone tells him. I've noticed him falling into a ""pattern"" when he talks to a certain girl, similar pattern when he was starting to court me. We started out as close friends, and I can tell that they're starting to get pretty close. Is this a sign?\n\nI'm not sure if this is just my imagination or I'm onto something. I love him very much.

She then text me late yesterday afternoon to say she's busy.\n\nSo I went out with my best friend who works with her and he got the impression that she doesn't want to go out with me. She said she's going away to study abroad for a year in a few weeks and thinks I've forgotten and doesn't really want to get into a relationship.

I apologize if this post is kind of all over the place, but trying to quick explain the situation. \n\nMy FH and I are both military (LDR for 4 years) and stationed at different bases.  We have been talking marriage for over a year, planning on doing a simple backyard ceremony within the next year or two.  Fast forward to recent times, and he has gotten overseas orders, leaving in fall of this year.  I am unable to go with him unless we are married.  \n\nTo top it all off, I was recently deployed for 6 months, and at the end of my deployment, my FH deployed to a different area.  By the time he gets back (late spring) it will have been a year since we've seen each other. \n\nAnyway, after discussion, we have decided to get married before he goes overseas.  Then, either I can try to apply to get orders with him, or I will be eligible to go be with him after my contract is up next year. \n\nHe is coming to visit me after he gets back from his deployment, and we have been discussing doing a court house marriage at that time.  The problem with this, is that both of our families would not be able to make it at that time (both his dad and my grandma are dealing with serious illnesses at this time).  We do not want to disappoint our families by getting married without them, but we absolutely cannot wait on the marriage due to the military. \n\nSo now for the advice....would we be terrible people for eloping/doing a court house wedding by ourselves....but only announcing engagement to everyone at that time?  We would plan to do a backyard wedding in fall before he leaves so that our families would have time to plan and be there.

Me [22M] and my [22F] ex girlfriend\nHey, first time post on here and I'm unsure how to handle myself.\n\nAbout last October (in 2013) I broke up with my long time girlfriend. We dated for about 6 years, throughout most of high school and a large portion of college. She was the first girl I dated and I really did care for her. I broke up with her because we were both abusive towards each other, physically (nothing extremely drastic but I have a scar on my arm because of her) and verbally.\n\nWe decided to stay friends after the break up and all seemed to be going well. However, I noticed that almost immediately (within like 2 weeks) after we broke up this guy she met from a club started hitting on her. She claims to have no attraction towards him but anyone with a pair of eyes can see there's a mutual attraction. Now I don't like this guy because he was hitting on her while we were still dating. I just got onto Facebook today to see her and a picture of him together celebrating his 21st birthday.\n\nI know I'm the one that broke it off and it's my fault for doing so, but I can't help but feel...betrayed? Is that normal? How should I handle myself? I feel like I want to punch something, as I still find myself caring for her, but that would only break my hand. I'm at a loss as to what to think/feel and I don't have anyone else around I can talk to about this. So, anyone have any thoughts?", Ex girlfriend of a long term relationship almost immediately starts flirting with another guy after I end the relationship.

Over the past week or so my SO of 6 months has been acting pretty out of the norm with me... We normally always say goodnight before bed and say we love each other but this past week it just hasn't really happened, I've said it but it's not been reciprocated at all.

Shortly after I apologised because I didn't want it to seem like I didn't want her and then she broke down crying saying that it was because she was gonna miss me a lot when she went to uni, but the thing is that she's never done anything like it before, whenever I've been upset she's always been comforting and said that we'd still see each other, so that prompted me to think further that something had been said in the messages and she'd acknowledged that I realised. She's now at home and flaming me for apologising and wanting a reason to initiate it, when before she did, nothing was going on, I'd went to get us a drink and we'd actually had sex about 2 hours before and both gotten off.

His family member adopted one of the kids he has (my friends kid.) as part of the agreement she signed away all rights at the age of 16 in order to never pay child support. She has since kept in contact with him and continues to be a part of his life.\n\nFast forward to today. The ""dad"" got sued for child support from another woman. He has a hefty fine to pay monthly. Now his family member who had adopted their kid wants to abandon the adoption and force the guardianship to default to the parents. My friend was pretty excited about this and wants to care for the kid, but now the ""dad"" says the kid might not want to live with her part time and that she should pay him child support (he's brought it up several times about how she should pay him child support since he's been sued.)\n\nAlso another weird thing was that he wanted to live with her. (It's pretty obvious he's had a thing for her the past 5 years since they broke up.) She's in a happy relationship and really doesn't want much to do with him. (After this he again brought up the child support.)\n\nThe lawyer she saw says there isn't much she can do because the guardianship is going to go to her and she'll have to help support the kid. My thing is that any money she gives this guy is going to go straight to pay for his other obligations, and not towards the kid.

Is this a bad idea or could this work?\nIt's a very long story so I'll try to summarize and provide details when asked. We have lived together since almost the start of our relationship and have always been extremely close. One of our issues has always been sexual needs. We split up a couple of days ago over this because he met someone at work who he immediately wanted to fuck their brains out and felt guilty and like it wasn't fair to me.\n\nI explained to him tonight that every human in a relationship has these feelings at one time or another (correct me if I'm wrong). I too have wanted to fuck other people before but have never considered ending the relationship because of it. I feel like it's important these things remain sexual-only and no emotions involved which he has already stated would be the case with the current girl in question.\n\nHe also didn't have many other sexual partners before me so it's definitely coming into play. This situation is also something I have considered in the past without him (being polyamorous/non- monogamous-not sure?) We have also discussed threesomes and such before.\n\nThe reason none of it has come to fruition before now is because of my own insecurities with my body. I'm trying to reach the point now of knowing its my only body and working it. I'm in the process of losing 30 lbs and have lost weight since we started dating. My weight has always been a strain on my sexual confidence especially in bed with him. \n\nSo on one hand I feel mostly okay with letting him fuck other women (and me fucking other men when I find someone appropriate) but I don't want to be jealous. I have thought all of this out without getting emotional at all so it's all with a clear head. I want to have our amazing and awesome relationship as partners and still be open to other things. I also don't want to be completely neglected by him and find a balance of healthy sex and also occasional sex with others. Is this possible? \n\nIs this appropriate? Would I be better off posting this to r/polyamory or  something?, A relationship in which we can fuck other people is something I have always been interested in but I'm afraid of my own insecurity getting in the way.

Soon after the train left the station a commotion began near the middle of the train car.  A little old man in a suit was standing and yelling (in what I think was Farsi) at a middle aged guy who looked like a pimp who was sitting down.  He was wearing a lot of gold &  sunglasses & a flashy shirt.  Imagine the old man from 'Up' yelling at Samuel L. Jackson.  The pitch of the conflict was starting to rise and I sprung into action.  I immediately stood and walked directly to where the confrontation was taking place (I'm a big guy).  As I walked through the train car, I noticed a kid had begun filming the men on his phone.  When I got there, I stood across the train car from the two men and just stared past them and did nothing.  They both saw me approach and expected me to do something. I did nothing, but my presence was known.  The old man was seething and muttering under his breath.  The pimp looking guy was smiling.   After a moment, I looked the old man in the eye, and then the pimp guy.  The argument stopped and we all stayed there in silence as people came on and off the train, until the last stop.  It was kind of awkward and I wished one of them would move.  At the last stop I moved across the train to make sure they got off before I did.  In my head I was a train Marshall.  The old man said one more thing to the guy as he exited and then they walked to opposite sides of the station.  Fight averted.

Cost and functionality were the biggest concern. I finally decided on the Forerunner 305 since it would do everything I wanted and was a good price (even though it's huge).\n\nBest price I found online was through Amazon for around $130, with free shipping if I wanted to wait 1-2 weeks. It was available at the local Best Buy for $150. Did a quick search and found a printable coupon good for the month of February at Best Buy for 20% off all ""Health & Fitness"" products.\n\nWent in to Best Buy and the price was $160 on the shelf. I found an employee (just happened to be a cute girl) nearby and told her I wanted to get the 305. She said she had that model and loved it...even more than some of the more expensive ones she tried (even though it's huge). She said she has run some marathons and we chatted a little bit about how I was just starting to run. She told me about some of the runs in the area, how the best ones tend to end with beer, and overall was very pleasant and informative while waiting in line at the cashier. I definitely hope to meet more cool people like her while pursuing this sport.\n\nSo I got to the cashier and the 305 rang up at $160 as expected. I mentioned the web site price was $150 and he price matched it. Then I gave him the 20% off coupon and it wouldn't scan. He tried typing in the number and it wouldn't take it. So he tried again and it accepted the coupon, but didn't apply the discount to the 305. He read the coupon, looked at the GPS, manually entered the 20% off and had a supervisor approve it. Super easy, out the door for $120.\n\nThe coupon should work on any ""Garmin Fitness GPS"" (that's an actual category on the Best Buy website), as well as any heart rate monitor or other brand of fitness GPS.\n\nHere's a link to the coupon.

Need help making a decision [Housing]\nHello!\n\nI am currently renting an apartment in Philadelphia for 800 dollars and am planning to move out at the end of June (the end of my lease). Unfortunately, I made the great mistake of forgetting that there was a line in my lease that states it automatically renews unless I tell my landlord 60 days in advance that I will not be renewing. Instead I told him 45 days in advance. I was then told I am on the hook for another 12 months with an increase in rent (850) unless another person takes the lease.\n\n On the positive side, the real estate agency that works for my landlord is attempting to find a leaser now, but since the landlord wants 850 for the lease, it is proving a challenge for the agent to find someone. In the meantime, I've found a cheaper apartment including utilities down the street and already put a deposit down (685 for deposit + 345 for half month of rent). It should be noted that my current apartment is extremely expensive because of the inefficient heating (160/month in winter) and it's in a rundown old building.\n\nMy question is that if a person cannot be found for my current lease, does it make sense to lose my deposit at the other apartment complex and just stay at my current apartment? Or should I gamble that someone will be found by the agent in the next two weeks? Or should I pay a month of double rent in the hopes that someone takes the lease by the end of July. However, I cannot afford to pay the two leases at the same time for an extending period of time(poor, stupid grad student on loans).\n\nI understand that my woes are caused by my own mistake of not being aware of my own lease, but I am trying to rectify the situation now with your help. Thank you in advance, and please ask if you need more info.", auto renewing lease. I'm on the hook for 12 more months in a crappy expensive apartment. Already put a deposit on new cheaper apartment.

I had to take out the Government loans as well as private loans. I have a question about my private loans. As you can see here,  this shows my principal balances, interest rates, and current interest accumulated. \n\n The 13.250% loan has a fixed interest rate, the others are variable. I would really like to pay off both my private and government loans as soon as possible, and I am trying to figure out the best way to do it.\n\n I am a little confused over the wording of the paperwork I have on them. For the loan I took out in 2009, the wording about prepayment is ""Prepayment will not result in a penalty. If you choose to pre-pay, you will not be entitled to a refund of any loan origination fees or any finance charges accrued through the date of repayment"" Does this mean, if I were to pay it off, I would only need to pay the current interest and the principal balance? The paperwork says that I would end up paying around $19,344 if I pay it over the 15 years, but if I pay it off sooner, I would pay less?\n\nThe other 3 loans have different wording. ""If you pay off your loan early, you will not have to pay a penalty. You will not be entitled to a refund of part of the finance charge"". To me, that seems like, even if you pay it off earlier, you would still need to pay all of the interest that would have accumulated over 15 years. Are my thoughts correct? \n\nAlso, considering all this information, how should I go about paying back my loans? I have $27,000 in government loans, + interest, plus these private loans."," confused about the wording of my private loans, and want some help figuring out how to pay back my government and private loans.",['•phrasing and structure can be improved.

We hit it off fairly quickly and began texting each other. A lot. We texted all day everyday for two weeks. Today, we finally met up. \n\nBefore I get into that, let me just say that while texting, she sort of fell for me. I like her, too, but still, I hadn't met her so I didn't know how much. I had told her I was looking for more than a hookup, and she said the same. She kept telling me how self conscious she is of her body, how much weight she's gained, and would send me pics of her asking if I was okay with her body. In the pics she sent me, she did seem a little chubby, but still very cute. I reassured her that I found her attractive, because from the pics, I really did.\n\nOn to our date. We had a great time together. Spent about 10 hours in total, including some heavy making out and fooling around. The problem is, she's a lot heavier than I had been anticipating. So much so, that I am just not that attracted to her, and had trouble staying hard when we were fooling around.\n\nWe didn't have sex, because she said she wanted to wait until we were ""official"" as if it was inevitable (and I'll admit, through texting, I thought it was inevitable as well). I just don't know what to do. She's already asking me what to do for our next date, and talking about future plans together, and I'm just kind of going along with it because I'm terrified of hurting an already very self-conscious person.

The first being, that I DONT over eat. I do however, drink incredible amounts of calories. I found I was drinking TWO THOUSAND calories on a good day. Well, clearly I've established what I need to change most, right? Right.\n\nThe next day, and every day since, I've completely stopped drinking soda, and went into what I believe was a sugar/caffeine withdrawal. Years of drinking hundreds upon hundreds of calories worth of soda has left me more than a little messed up. I allow myself 1 glass of coke a week, and so far this has kept off any cravings, yay! \n\nNow for the advice I need. As I said, I've been tracking my progress with myfitnesspal, hoping to lose 100lbs within a year. Myfitnesspal puts me at approximately 2500cal/day at a loss of 2lbs/week. And I'm actually having trouble meeting this. Just wondering if I should be concerned if I'm not even coming close to the calories that are suggested I eat in a day.

We got together for a common hobby, one that he almost can't participate in anymore because of chronic pain issues in hands, shoulders and feet. I'm as supportive as I can be, goes with him to doctors appointments, helps with calls, deals with his anxiety when it gets out of hand, it feels like I'm more of a caretaker than partner at this point. He has been out of school and job for a year at this point because of pain.\n\nI have 5 hours of school Monday to Friday while he's out 2 hours, I'm still the one who starts cleaning when I get home. 5/7 days a week I fix dinner, I wash our clothes and do most of the dishes.

Some days he will tell me it's especially bad, it just feels like I lack the empathy at this point, and I feel bad for not being caring enough. It's not because the pain isn't real, and he is in the middle of new medication for it, but it might very well be forever.\n\nI recently got the option to go to another country for my education. He can't go with me, if I choose to do so, and I would basically drop him on the floor because he's dependant on me, and I would feel like the world's biggest asshole.

For example there was a girl a while back I was seeing and she kind of messed me about a bit, was rubbish at texting back, organising stuff, but usually when we were together it was amazing.\n\nAnyway, one weekend, I'd organised for us to go to the ballet and I was trying to make plans for what we were gonna do before/after and the day before I texted her asking what she fancied doing/what time she'd be free but didn't hear from her until 3 the following day, 2 hours before the ballet started. Anyway, she didn't really have any reason for not replying, nor did she really make much of an apology and it annoyed me. Consequently I couldn't really shake the feeling of being pissed off with her and so when we did meet up, I found it hard to act like I wanted to be with her. Kind of ruined the evening, and made things really awkward.\n\nSo I'm now seeing a new girl and I feel like this is going down a similar route. Not as bad, but I really don't want my hang-ups to be the downfall to this situation, I just don't know how to shake that feeling short of have a few drinks before I see her and that's probably not the best plan of action!

I ended up with several relatively light scars on my forearms, belly, and upper thighs. Those ones are usually not noticeable and while some people point them out they're pretty easy to shrug off. However, I also have much deeper scars running up the entirety of my upper arms, and now that it's summer again and I'm going out in tshirts and tank tops, people won't stop asking about them. They're raised and heavy and very obviously self-inflicted. \n\nIt seems like everyone from my boss to my Spanish professor (in front of the whole class, which is what prompted this post) has pointed them out. Some people are nice about it, and of course some are really rude, but it always makes me uncomfortable because I just don't know what to tell them.\n\nI've tried covering the scars with concealer and followed some home remedies to make them less noticeable but nothing has really worked so far. I don't think they're going away any time soon, and I'm in the American south so it would be difficult to spend all summer in long sleeves or sweaters. \n\nI don't want to feel like my scars are something I should be ashamed of for the rest of my life. But I also don't want to be stuck explaining a very personal and painful part of my history to strangers all the time. With little kids I can spin some crazy story and laugh about it, with adults I usually tell them they're just old scars, but some people really won't take the hint. One of my coworkers straight up told me I was just looking for attention after I tried to shrug it off. But I don't want attention or pity or a therapy session with strangers; I just want to be able to wear short sleeves this summer.\n\nI guess I just don't know the etiquette on this.

Four days ago he came over and we finally kissed again and we had a loooong talk. I explained that telling somebody you don't love them, and wont have sex with them, isn't a real relationship. He had many many emotional outbursts in the past, which I explained were totally unacceptable. \n\nThen he pulled what feels like a high school girl move and opened up about a dark secret (long story is he was taken advantage of by a Sugar Daddy who helped pay for college expenses and it had repercussions that manifested as intimacy issues).

She made social networks behind my back, kept constantly controlling me, going out (she doesn't go to school or work) and kept lying to me. \n\nThe only reason I stayed with her was because I knew a breakup would really hurt me in school, especially during finals. I broke it off after school ended and she tried getting me back for a week until I started talking to her again. Things were fine and then she had to move a thousand miles away to her mothers house.\n\nWe decided to stay together long-distance since I graduate college in a year. She has been super nice to me but the past couple days she hasn't been texting me for long periods. I decided to look into it and I found out she has been using a dating website and snapchat to meet guys in her area. \n\nI made a fake account and started talking to her. She started flirting with me and telling me she doesn't have a boyfriends ect. I am going to call her in the morning, what do I say? I'm so broken crying and drinking my life away since I have no friends. My whole life was dedicated to her and school.\n\nThe thing that concerns me the most is that I won't be able to concentrate in school.

I, in turn, enjoy trolling him back. Recently, he received a dare to post something serious to his facebook as part of a prank. The way the prank works is that if somebody messages you about the serious thing you posted, you are given something by them to post on your wall. The joke spreads around like that, and is sort of stupid in my opinion. A few days later, I see he has posted to his wall ""My Grandmother went to heaven today."" With the odd wording, and me hearing nothing of his grandma's ill health, I assumed it was another one of his prank posts to lure more people in to his silly joke. I thought it would be rather funny to mess with some of the believers in the comments of the post.\n\nI type ""Good riddance"" into the comments and, within seconds, I receive a reply from one of his friends I did not know saying ""That's horrible. Why would you say something like that?"" With a lack of better judgement, I decide not to hold back. I go on a rant spreading lies about his grandmother: ""She was a horrible person and a menace to society"", ""She even ran over my cat and never apologized"", ""I went to AssHat's house and saw alot of German WWII related items."", ""That monster was literally a nazi!"", ""She's scum of the earth and we're better off without her.""\n\nI felt pretty accomplished with my trolling, not even considering the possibilty his grandmother could have actually died. Later that night, I returned to facebook only to see my comments had been deleted, and AssHat's comment about the awful things I had said. Turns out his Grandmother had actually died that day, and I was the worst best friend in the world.

One thing that bothers me sometimes is that I have been purposefully vague about my past relationships and I don't know if I need to open up to him and tell him everything. We are both quiet, introverted people that don't necessarily share every minute detail, so it hasn't been a big deal. \n\nI was in an emotionally abusive relationship in the past, and had a couple of short-term relationships after that where I was still emotionally unstable. I did some things I am not proud of (breaking up by no contact with one guy, dated another controlling man and then kissed someone else so we would break up) when I was younger. However, I've matured and learned about healthy relationships. I've been in 1-2 healthy relationships before I met my current boyfriend. Most people who know me now don't know any of this, and I an genuinely happy and fulfilled in my personal and professional life. It's only when I sometimes think back to the past I sort of freeze up inside.\n\nI have tried to see a couple of therapists (one after I ended the abusive relationship, and one a few years after that). But both of them stopped seeing me after a few sessions because I seemed pretty well-adjusted and was capable of dealing with the issues. I got some good advice about accepting myself and having healthy habits (exercise, eating well, sleeping well, etc.) to cope, but otherwise nothing major. The message I took away was that the past is in the past and I should work on the here and now. \n\nMy question is, do I need to tell my current boyfriend the entire truth? He knows about the abusive relationship (not the details, just that I was in one) and that I was ""wild"" in my youth (but again, not specifically what). I am very happy in my current relationship, we are both supportive of each other, and this never comes up.

She threw a huge tantrum and was just out of control. Because I'm a lawyer I stay rather calm, even when there's a fight and hate when it gets too emotional and dramatic. After an hour everything that can be said, is said. It just makes me feel so weird, when she keeps going. I just hate it. I don't make her responsible for it as a person, because every girl I've been with long enough has her moments.\n\nAnyway. We got into the fight on a Thursday. On Friday she came around and she was being cute again. I didn't feel like it was over for me and I was annoyed that she thought it was okay just like that. Anyway, I left town the same day and stayed in San Diego over the weekend. The result was that I fucked 3 women until Sunday was over. To be honest, I didn't enjoy the sex that much. It's so much better with my girlfriend. Without emotions it doesn't mean much.\n\nThe last time I posted it, everyone told me to confess it, but I never planned to do that and I will not do it. There is no way to prove that it happened, not even I could prove it. She doesn't suspect a thing. I picked up the phone to talk to her even when someone else was there, so she thinks I was alone the whole time.\n\nSo I came back and now it's going better than ever. I realized that I want her and that as her boyfriend I am able to control her emotions a fair bit. Not in a mean way, but I want her to feel appretiated and happy, and not the need to start fights to get what she wants. Also I feel like that weekend gave me a chance to think about us and what I want. It's definitely her. She's beautiful, smart and 99% of the time super loving.

We would talk and the responses would be more curt, and where we used to waste hours just incessantly texting back and forth, we eventually settled in to a likely more healthy, but slower pattern of communication. She also took to tweeting extremely cryptic things, while for the most part putting on a happy face during our communications.\n\nI deal with some insecurity and depression for which I'm supposed to be taking meds. And her changed behavior gave me some anxiety about the status of our relationship, especially because on facebook she maintained the same active social life, going out with her mostly male friends who had during my time abrouad made their dislike of me very obvious.\n\nHer distance and the tweets deviated enough from her normal behavior that I finally addressed it on Skype, and she eventually admitted that she had these intense feelings of depression and external pressure and was in therapy for her issues, but for the most part refused to elaborate beyond that. \n\nThis conversation happened maybe two months ago, and since then we've gone through different extremes, extremely close and upbeat to distant and withdrawn.

At first I assumed it was from smoking (I'm not a heavy smoker, maybe a few a day for several years, with plenty of week-long breaks) so I quit. It  got better but not completely better, it was still visible in the back of my throat while the other wasn't. I went to the doctor who prescribed antibiotics (which didn't do much). She said there's no reason to do anything  about it unless it's bothering me enough to want surgery. I probably should've mentioned to her  that I smoke but I didn't think of it at the time. I highly doubt  it's cancer though, I'm young and healthy other than the smoking (I know that sounds ridiculous  haha)\n\nSince then, I've been an on-and-off smoker (mostly during exams or nights of drinking) and sometimes my tonsil is fine but  other times, like right now, it gets really swollen and uncomfortable. I know that I should stop smoking and that's the plan, but for now can anyone offer  any ideas as to  what's causing this? Or any advice on how to reduce swelling? I've tried  gargling water, vinegar etc. without much improvement.\n\nI should mention I've had tonsilloliths before but have not had any (visible/noticeable)  ones in probably over a year."," Tonsil has been swollen for the  past few years, gets worse with smoking.

We'd been together for about a year with an 8 hour time difference. He told me he couldn't handle being so far apart from me anymore and it was causing him a lot of stress. I felt the same way too; I had a lot of anxiety, and so we decided to stay as friends. We still talked regularly as if nothing had changed, except that we cut the ""I love you's"" and pet names. But 2 weeks ago I found out that he has a new girlfriend. I was more upset about the fact that he didn't tell me about it. I suppose because we were friends now we could talk about anything, especially about something as major as that. He said he was afraid to ""lose"" me if he'd told me.\n\nHe still talks to me regularly. I try to avoid him when I can now. I thought he'd rather focus on his new relationship, and so I started talking to a guy on Tinder. We'd meet regularly, mainly for sex. At some point I just forgot to check my phone so I was avoiding calls and texts from my ex. He then asked me if he'd done something wrong because he felt that I was avoiding him. \n\nWhen I told him I was seeing someone, he became really upset/jealous and even said that I deserve better than a guy who just wants to fuck me. We talked for 3 hours about this, and he admitted that he still has feelings for me, that he really loves me but the distance is holding us back. He said his girlfriend is great but not as ""amazing"" as me.  He missed the connection we had. I feel the same way. And now I think we're equally confused.

I have seen it with my own eyes, but I want to get this off of my chest.\n\nI was dating this girl for awhile, about a year and a month or two. We met freshman year of uni basically when I moved in and a month later we were going out. Because of this all of my friends are awkwardly her friends. Either way, when we ""broke up,"" but it was a soft break... I kissed her goodbye before I got on my train home from uni for winter break and she went home and is away this semester for an internship. \n\nThis semester has been hard because I tried talking to her online, not realizing that we were actually broken up for sure (not just breaking because of distance). At the same time she dumps more reasons on me as to why we have broken up. Throughout this I got aggravated, because she was not upfront when we broke up. So after telling me she needs sometime to find herself and be single (100% no ties to me). She gets an OkCupid and is now going out with a guy long distance at another uni in my area (Northeastern). Which completely contradicts the reasons she gave me for breaking up, besides the ones which point to me being a bad person.\n\nThis girl was always a little odd I suppose, but I really loved her. She broke up with me a month after we started dating, but I somehow won her back. She sticks with guys traditionally, but also is a little flighty and doesn't make solid decisions, ever (changed majors every semester or more)...\n\nIt has been 4 months, I am still not 100% over her and she is coming back to the area for the summer (I am staying in the city this summer). I am worried about my old friends, my new friends (which she feels she has claim to) and just my happiness in general. I still love this girl a little, but I mostly just want to move on.

My 23 year old sister is going through her 3rd kind of cancer in her life and I'm at the point where I don't know how to feel anymore.\n\nWe came to America from Syria when I was very young because both my sister and my twin brother had cancer at the same time (him, testicular, her, brain) for the better medical treatment options available in the states and we've been here ever since trying to deal with a new life and new surroundings. Sadly, my twin died when we were around seven,  but my sister survived both the brain cancer and the pancreatic cancer that sprang up on us about five years ago.\n\nSurprisingly still, she survived that as well, but as far as I can surmise, some of the tumor was not removed and it ended up growing around the stomach. Recently, she has barely been able to eat more than a bite for the entire day and if she tries, she ends up throwing everything up. She's nearing barely eighty pounds and is always in pain.\n\nI'm constantly surrounded by the emotional trauma and stress of a family in crisis and I don't know what to do anymore. My dad has worked himself dry trying to support a family and a sick child, and we've all come out of these struggles with more scars than we can count.\n\nI love her dearly and even though we don't talk and aren't the closest, simply imagining her not being a part of my life anymore makes me shut down.

Its senior year of High School and I just lost my two best friends to each other.\n\nAnd then the clincher to it all. He convinces her that me being trans is just an act I do for attention. She, for whatever reason, believes him over me suddenly.

Studies generally find the number to be between 20 to 30 percent, but in 2011 the number went down to 14%. If these people are so armed with expertise and knowledge, why do people who don't understand anything about financial theory get more just by passively investing in an index fund? If anything, financial ""knowledge"" seems to do more harm than good.\n\nWhen looking at the stuff they teach in universities, you have to wonder how they keep on believing these theories despite the mountain of counterevidence. Stocks are assumed to generate returns relative to risk, quantified as beta in CAPM. Yet, beta has had almost zero correlation with stock returns starting in 1982. If you look at the studies that confirm beta's predictive power, they all used data from the 1970s. But people still use beta to create portfolios.\n\nHow about efficient market theory? Under the theory, stock bubbles should not exist since everythingn is properly priced. But they do exist. Instagram valued at 1 billion despite having no revenue? Definitely properly priced.\n\nEven option pricing models are ridiculous. One model assumes that you can borrow money at the risk-free rate and stocks only generate risk-free rate returns. The black-scholes model also assumes that risk is normally distributed, without looking at historical data, leading to black and scholes' own bankruptcy. \n\nWanna know how we price stocks? We pull magic numbers out of our asses and make it interact with other equally bullshit number to come up with an arbitrary value. Then we try to convince other people that our bullshit is, in fact, legit. The only way stock valuation models are accurate is if stock analysts are clairvoyant and can see 10 years into the future. But even then the analyst won't have to calculate anything and just tell us the stock price.", Financial theories need supernatural clairvoyance and are based on arbitrary assumptions that ignore real world and data.

Also rumors got out that she was pregnant (she wasn't).\nAll this had a devastating impact on her self esteem and ego, meanwhile her boyfriend had gotten seriously depressed and was absolutely intolerable to deal with. The guy from the party started talking to her again. They met a few times under different circumstances, he would get her drunk, and have sex with her.\nShe left her boyfriend and soon after stopped seeing the other guy too.

There are a couple of reasons why this is weird to me.\n\nFirst, we've been friends for about 3 years, and has never seemed interested in me. When I first told her about my crush on her, she got really distant, and it took a while just to be comfortable around her again, but now our relationship is as strong as ever.\n\nSecond, she's really involved with another guy, who I personally think is below her standards. However, I try and stay out of the relationship as much as possible and just let them do their thing. However, she has gotten more and more flirty with me as she has been dating this guy.\n\nShe is very, very uncomfortable with touching other people, but recently (as in last weekend), began to put her arm on my shoulder, tickle me, hit me playfully, and is allowing me to do the same. This morning in class, i was tickling her, and she was perfectly fine. Then another of her friends put their hand on her shoulder to ask her a question, and she freaked out.\n\nI've also noticed that she has started talking really quietly around me, forcing me to move my head in closer so I can hear her. When I do this, she flits her eyes between my eyes and my lips.

I feel like I did it because I felt very low about myself, felt nice to have someone make me feel good. It was not a serious crush/liking.

Thanks.)\n\nSome background information: Over the past 4 months or so, I developed what I thought was a pretty close friendship with a girl whom I had known for the majority of my life, but had never really taken time to speak with until this year. In that time I discovered that she was an absolutely awesome person; very smart, and very funny and just enjoyable to be around. Up until just a few weeks ago we would talk for 3-4 hours a day on Skype, and I enjoyed all of it.\n\nNow onto the problem: In the time I spoke to her, she mentioned Prom on several occasions, asking questions like ""Do you know what day Prom is"", also mentioning the occasion when other girls post dress pictures to Facebook, making it a semi-frequent topic for short amounts of conversation. Now I, lacking minor social skills, came to the conclusion that these were some kind of hints, and decided to man-up and ask her. After a relatively simple outing, on the way back home I decided that I would ask, and she proceeded to turn me down. In all honesty, getting turned down is not a huge deal, it is what follows that bothers me.\n\nSince that day, she has not spoken to me at all, it has been 3 weeks now. She wouldn't return any of my texts (all three that I sent over those weeks), removed me from Facebook, and then removed me from her Skype contacts. She avoids communicating with me in person, and appears to avoid me now. There is nothing that I would want more than to continue on as we were just several weeks ago, but she appears to want none of it. I think I may have overstepped my boundaries in asking her to Prom, but being completely put out in the cold like this seems ridiculous, and frustrates me to no end.\n\nMy question is whether I should attempt to repair what I thought was a excellent friendship, or should I just try to let her go?"," Asked a close friend to Prom, I was turned down, now she won't speak to me; should I try to fix what is broken, or just let her go?","['The summary differs in meaning when said ""close friend"" rather than ""a girl"" ']",5.0,6.0,5.0,7.0,0.5597248077392578,118.43274193548388,0.0,204.85889445707684,0.3557434622866854,0.0,0.4958135485649109,0.8796669244766235,0.7917293310165405,0.8333847522735596,0.1184510250569476,0.0635696821515892,0.8666666666666667,0.0366132723112128,0.0196078431372549,0.2758620689655172,0.0911161731207289,0.0488997555012225,0.6666666666666666

We were friends, she broke up with her fiancé, needed a place to stay and i offered her my spare bedroom. Granted it wasn't anything more than platonic until about 3 months in. Then it was on and off sex, and I gradually fell for her. Now the ex-fiance never really left the picture, but I didn't understand just how much of an issue it was until now. The only reason I went through her iPad to see the texts (we both have apple products only) was because her ex messaged me on Facebook and sent me some... not very pretty screenshots. However these didn't include a date or anything, so I opted to not believe him. But the seed of doubt was placed and it just grew from there. I honestly thought my girlfriend was only ever talking to me (while we were dating, she said this multiple times). We've only been official for about a month mind you, but I read some stuff that makes me question her feelings for me. Basically she never stopped talking to her ex (even though she claimed otherwise) and was also seeing another guy and telling him that she was ""falling pretty hard for him"". Don't chastise me for going through her texts, I feel like shit for it already. I normally don't do that, but something in my gut just told me to. The worst part is that we have a lease together and theres still about 6 months left. I honestly don't know what to do or feel.

I just recently got out of a long term relationship of 5 years. My ex and I used to attend the same university, but I got into med school and since moved away. The distance was rough on us, and it led to a lot of changes on my end. In the end, we decided to end it and did so amicably. When we first broke up, I asked that we remain friends and still update one another one each other's lives. At first, I thought that I could easily fall back into being friends with him, but I realized that it was too painful to talk to him or text him and be reminded of the end of the relationship. \n\nA few days after the break up, he called me, and I didn't pick up because I knew it would be too painful to speak to him. I sent him an email explaining that I wanted no contact for a little while so that we could both heal from the break up. I did have nothing from him for a day or so, but this morning I woke up and saw a text from him wishing me luck for an upcoming test. Seeing the text made me sad and a little upset that he is unwilling to respect the no-contact rule that I requested.\n\nI think that he continues to reach out to me because he doesn't have as good of a support group as I do (family and friends who support me and check in on me periodically), and for the past 5 years, I was that support. So, he is reaching out to me, but I don't think that reaching out to me will help either of us heal. I don't want to be mean and ignore him especially since I still care for him, but at the same time, I told him that I needed distance and time and no contact through texting, calling, etc. What should I do?

We fell in love fast and hard, and were completely absorbed in our relationship for a while. And slowly it's just been fading. I love him, but I'm not in love. \n\nThere's no romance. He always gets upset at me for things that shouldn't be an issue at all (like wanting to go out and have a girls night). He spends his days sleeping and playing video games, he has no interest in working or working out or taking care of himself (or me). I feel like I'm scared to do anything because he always finds reasons to yell at me. I'm just not happy. He has told me multiple times that he doesn't trust me, and to a point I think he is very controlling (or tries to be). \n\nIt's hard. We live together, and have spent 99% of our time together for the last two years. I love him, and he loves me, but I just can't do this anymore. I need to experience being single and doing my own thing and having freedom.

We hung out and talked some more. We've been friends for over a month now. While I was with my ex-boyfriend, we never communicated. Pretty sure I only saw him once or twice. Today, I worked another promotion and he came to see me . He came alone, ordered a drink, and waited for my shift to be over. We took one of the bottles and laid around in the woods. I really like him by now. Im obsessed with when we're hanging out next. I brought up a talk about my feelings. He said I'm a really nice gal, but I'm also the ex-girlfriend of one of his really good friends and that he doesn't want to cause problems and if roles were revered, he wouldn't want his friend with his ex-girlfriend. Which is a totally fair response. I didn't know what to really say. So I just dropped the topic. Did I misread signs? He seemed into me. Or maybe I was too hopeful?

Ofcourse his friend wouldn't know that. He even girlfriended the last side chick according to facebook.

Who finds replacement?\nHello,\nI don't know if this is so much a legal question or more of a responsibility question- So I moved out of my studio last month paying $650 per month in Chicago. I moved down the block to someone off of Craigslist because I thought the place was great. A house in a city with a porch! I love porches! But living there for a few days, I found that I didn't inspect the place well enough- the place is pretty ratty for a number of reasons, and my roommate doesn't seem that motivated to make improvements. He's a nice guy, but not really the cleanest. The situation is kind of awkward since when I brought up making improvements or contacting the landlord, he didn't seem that enthusiastic and basically responded that the landlord was unlikely to respond to fixing our broken sink and things like that. Well anyways, I found a much cheaper place ($300 cheaper per month! It's just not nearly as convenient a location: 2 miles from train instead of a block). But the people are already my friends and I think I could be a lot more relaxed there. The newer place would actually feel like my place instead of living in someone else's place.\n\nMy question is this- since my roommate described it as a month to month deal, here are my questions- \n•	Whose responsibility is it to find someone to take over my room?\n•	How much advanced warning should I give my current roommate without making this too weird? Immediately?\n•	Should I tell him I'm leaving cuz the place sucks or should I say I found a much cheaper living situation?\n•	How can I protect myself in this situation?\n\nI literally have not signed a thing and my name is not on anything. That may have been really irresponsible since  I don't really have any protection but I don't have any responsibilities either necessarily.\n\nIf I posted in to the incorrect subreddit, lemme know.\n\nAny advice would be helpful. Thank you!"," Moved in at beginning of September to month to month rental place without lease, decided I'm moving out end of September. who's responsible for finding new tenant- me or other roommate whose lived there whole summer?","[""Says information not in the post.

I was going through old pictures on our computer and I found this one naked picture of him from years ago.

I went to a large Labor Day party in the town I live in, at the request of some of my friends who were playing music at said party. I was standing in front of the stage, just zoning out and listening to the guys play. \n\nAll of a sudden, I noticed two (lady) arms shooting out around my sides. I ignored it thinking she was trying to dance with someone behind me. She continues to dance and makes her way in front of me. I'm still kinda just zoning out and don't really pay much attention, until her face is about two inches away from mine. She asks me if I'm having a good time and I of course say yes. She then asks why I'm not dancing, and I lie and say I don't know how. I proceed to do a kind of stupid shimmy thing, because why be serious? \n\nShe laughed and said that was how she danced too, and started doing it next to me. I continued to do so for a minute or so, and then stopped. She leaned in again and said something, but I couldn't hear her over the music. Instead of asking her to repeat herself, or moving away from the stage and speakers to talk, I proceeded to just give her a small smile, like she said something funny. She kept dancing next to me for a few songs, gave me a weird look, and left with her friend, who I guess was behind me the entire time. \n\nAbout fifteen minutes later, the band takes a break, and my buddy who was playing came up to me and asked me why I didn't dance with the girl. Evidently from the stage he saw her make a beeline for me from the back of the party. Of course, I had just assumed she knew someone in the band and just wanted to be close to the stage. It took me a few more minutes to realize that she was probably into me, and I completely blew my chance."," Went to a party, had a girl come dance up on me, was too dense to realize she was flirting, and blew my chance with one of the cutest girls I had seen in a while.",['•[cutest girls] added info. \\n\\n•great summary to represent the post.

We set her up in the bathroom because we thought the small space would make it easier for her to transition. So now the problems, she only sits by the toilet when my Fiancee and I are around; She eats in front of me but only if I place the food in front of her and only stands up after extensive petting. She will immediately sit after I'm done petting as well. She's extremely jump and the tiniest noise causes her to curl into a ball and hide her head behind the toilet. She doesn't play, at least not with me, and a laser pointer causes her to go stroke mode and again, hide her head behind the toilet. She doesn't hiss at anything that I've found out yet.. So my question is, does my cat just need more time to get used to her space, and what can I do to get her to come out of her shell? Her history at the shelter says they found her as a new appearance in a Feral colony, so they thought she was a stray. I don't think she's feral because she lets you touch her (not pick her up; and bring your face even close to her is a nono...) She also hasn't tried to escape the house...or leave the bathroom at all (except one night when she tugged my electric shaver down and it caused her to run laps around the house."," Adopted a shy cat who is the biggest wuss I've ever met, I don't think she's feral, need HALP.","['Accuracy points are off for ""adopted a shy cat who is the biggest wuss"" and ""HALP"", both are compatible.

I went back to the guide on the other site, and they've added new pages to their guide, which have even more similarities to mine.

All I really want is that, if they are using my guide to supplement theirs, they at least include a link to my guide or a reference somewhere.  I worked on it for months, and it was the foundation for a paper about lolcats that I presented at a folklore conference this Fall.\n\nAt the same time, I can't help thinking maybe I'm just over-analyzing this and I should just be glad people are enjoying my field guide?

Help!\nI'm coming to you with a weird problem which has probably occurred before. However, I am curious to see what others think about this problem, and if anyone has any tips for dealing with it.\nA few months ago I had a falling out with someone I considered a great friend. I won't really go into details other than to say that we were both at fault with our shitty behaviours. Nevertheless, I am trying to put this episode in the past. However, we are no longer friends at all anymore.\n\nHowever, we have a lot of mutual friends. I have purposefully kept quiet about the situation to avoid drama, but my former friend seems to have been gossiping to her close friends about me. So it appears that there's a whole group of people who think I'm not worth being around.\n\nNormally that wouldn't annoy me, because I have a lot of good friends and not a whole lot of free time due to my job, career prospects, etc. However, I do occasionally have to see this former friend at parties. Usually her group of friends is with her and I can't help but feel anxious when I know I'm going to be seeing her. However, these gatherings are the only times I get to see some of my other friends, so I don't want to avoid them altogether.\n\nHas anyone ever been in similar position here? How did you deal with it? I have a feeling that even if I try saying a polite hello, my former friend will just ignore me. Should I even try to be polite? I want to avoid awkwardness but it's difficult when you have mutual friends who don't know what happened. But I can't help but feel really keen anxiety when I think about having to interact with her. I really don't want to, but I want to see my friends. \n\nDo you recommend talking to my friends about what's happened, or just staying quiet for now? I didn't want to stir drama but was thinking that maybe at least some of my close friends"," Had falling out with friend, still have to see her at parties with her group of friends, feel anxiety about going but still want to be social.

I was going through some big changes with graduating college and finding a job that was fulfilling for me- my hopes and dreams were a bit unrealistic, and I only worked on and off during college so it was a stressful transition. Anyway, I leaned too much on him for emotional support because we were always around one another and I didn't consider the amount of strain it would put on the relationship. We had other problems, namely expectations of his friends and family. I'm kind of a proponent of the idea that expectations skew reality, but whatever, people still see what they're primed to see.\n\nI think we both wanted to take the relationship to the next level but the reality is that we're not logistically at the same point in life and we might never be.

Especially if one has no real intention to work in academia even after grad school ...\nRather self-explanatory post, but just to elaborate a little further...\n\nHas anyone, after working for a period of time, decided for whatever reasons to head back into academia to pursue a PhD in Computer Sc, with no intention to join the world of academia but intend to head back into the industry? If so, what were the reasons. Also, how did it turn out? Was there anything that you regretted? Did it work out?\n\nThe reason I'm asking for advice is because currently I'm employed full-time, and know how fortunate I am to have a job in these hard times. However, being from a foreign country and working in the UK, they are making it difficult for one to extend one's working visa because I do not possess a Masters/PhD and only a Bachelor's. \n\nIt's just a little frustrating because I have been here almost half a decade now, but I have been sitting on a visa that has no count towards residency and soon, I will have to apply for a visa with even more restrictions. \n\nI'm thus considering boosting up my paper qualifications, so as to prevent myself from being in such a situation ever again. I believe the stipend from grad school actually pays almost as much as I am earning now (in terms of spending power, not direct currency conversion), but of course, given if I spent 5 years working as opposed to studying, there might be opportunities for raises/promotions.\n\nObviously, plunging into a PhD solely for that reason is bound to get looks of disapproval. I am, of course, interested in expanding my knowledge and having an opportunity to have time for myself. I have had research experience (published a paper, presented at conferences) so I'm aware of the challenges research presents.\n\nAny advice from people who have gone through similar situations?

Bearing in mind i only know her and a mutual friend, the rest of the people i don't have a clue who they are. \n\nWhy on earth would a woman want to remain friends with a 3 month relationship (with whom she went distant from)? Should also note it's not alot of communication, it's literally maybe once a week or two since our split 4 months ago (yes 4 MONTHS...)", Would you attend an ex's birthday?

There was this guy who had a house with a big ramp that goes to the garage (which was also the main floor of the house).We would ride a bike as fast as we could all the way down the ramp until the front tire hits a wall (not very clever I know, it was hell fun tho).  \nIt turns that we only had this old bike with a broken seat - it didn't have anything covering it up, so the three tiny irons that work as the structure were exposed.\nAfter riding the ramp a couple times I noticed that something went wrong. At that moment, I only noticed a small cut on my thigh. But I started to feeling that there was *something else* . I was afraid of finding out what actually happened and I was feeling really embarrassed to ask for help (I thought my brother's friends would make fun of me or something). So I stayed behind a small wall near the gate while they were playing on the street (I didn't have a plan, I don't know what I was doing lol). Then a neighbor sees me there, hiding and crying. She immediately tells my brother about it, I don't say what is going on so he takes me home. Once mom gets home I have to tell her. When she looks at it she got desperate and 30 min later I am at the emergency room getting 9 stitches on my scrotum. \nI got a Y-shape scar.", I was riding a bike with a broken seat all the way down a big ramp. I hit the wall and the seat cuts my sac. I got 9 stitches on it.,['•complete summary.'],7.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,0.4649240970611572,113.12246204933588,0.0,140.38759208863783,0.4614632841580227,0.0,0.3794359266757965,0.9111965298652648,0.8060883283615112,0.8554257750511169,0.1867469879518072,0.1033333333333333,0.96875,0.0909090909090909,0.0501672240802675,0.4838709677419355,0.1325301204819277,0.0733333333333333,0.6875
